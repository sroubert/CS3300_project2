While warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico filtered north and encompassed the region, a series of potent upper level disturbances began lifting northeast across the Lower Mississippi River Valley. This set the stage for multiple rounds of torrential rains that fell almost continuously across the ArkLaMiss from March 8th through March 12th.

It tracked into the South Delta Regional Correctional Facility. Quite a bit of damage was done to the facility as it took a direct hit. Several large sections of the outer fence were torn down. Five buildings on the south side of the complex sustained roof damage where shingles and sheet paper were removed. The gym building, a metal structure, was heavily damaged where a large section of wall was removed. The main building of the complex suffered roof damage where roughly half of the roof was lifted or had parts removed. The roof is not a typical roof; it has several layers. Large portions of the foam insulation were pulled out along with several sections of a thin roof covering. A couple of the guard watch towers had the windows blown out and some minor damage. One employee was injured trying to exit a tower and broke a leg. The tornado then moved into a wooded area, where trees were snapped and a metal carport was thrown and destroyed. As the tornado crossed Highway 35, many more trees were damaged. One home sustained minor roof damage on the south side of the highway. The tornado crossed US Highway 65 and snapped more trees. It then continued through a large wooded area and farmland and it moved into Desha County. It then crossed Highway 159 where many more trees were snapped and uprooted. Where it crossed Highway 159, a home sustained some minor roof damage and had the wood framed shed destroyed. A few power lines were down here as well. The tornado continued northeast into a wooded area where more trees were damaged. Though the tornado likely dissipated a bit farther east, no access was available to that area due to flooding.

The tornado touched down one-half mile southwest of the intersection of Amish Road and Spring Garden Road then travelled to the northeast at a speed of around 50 mph, staying on the ground for 7 minutes. An estimated 50 buildings sustained damage along the path of the tornado. Two large farm outbuildings and one two-story residence sustained major roof damage near the intersection of Amish Road and Spring Garden Road. This marked the transition of the tornado from EF-1 to EF-2. A van with several passengers travelling west on Spring Garden Road near the same intersection was blown about 10 feet to the north of the road into a field. Approximately one-half mile to the northeast along Millwood Road, additional EF-2 damage occurred as roofs were blown off several farm outbuildings, barns and one two-story residence. A pine tree located in the front yard of this house was stripped of most of its branches and foliage, with only a few larger bare limbs remaining. A wooden barn behind the residence was completely destroyed with substantial debris carried several hundred yards to the northeast across a field. Mid-to-high end EF-1 damage to roofs was noted to several farm buildings and homes along the east-west portion of Millwood Road and along Old Philadelphia Pike near School Lane Road. A significant amount of debris in the form of crumpled sheet metal from roofs was scattered across fields adjacent to Meeting House Road to the north of Old Philadelphia Pike. A second area of concentrated EF-2 damage was noted near the intersection of Seldomridge Road and Cambridge Road. The tornado knocked over several large granite tombstones in a cemetery, then stripped about one-quarter of the roof off a large building where more than 100 people were attending an auction. The final location of EF-2 damage was noted along Kauffroth Road just a few hundred yards to the north of the intersection with Seldomridge Road. It was here where a large one-room metal amish school was completely destroyed and blown about 100 yards uphill into a field. The tornado began to weaken from this point with the final EF-1 damage noted near the intersection of Gault Road and Rosehill Drive, where significant damage occurred to roofs and siding on several homes and sheds. Numerous softwood trees were also uprooted at the end of the tornado path about 100 yards to the north of Thistle drive. The tornado was rated as a high-end EF-2, with peak winds estimated at 125 mph. There were no injuries or fatalities.",CSV

Meanwhile, a weak frontal boundary entered the region from the west on the 8th, and became stationary over Deep East Texas, Northwest Louisiana, and Southwest Arkansas. Upper level disturbances ejected northeast ahead of the Northern Mexico low pressure system, resulting in periods of showers and thunderstorms containing heavy rainfall to move repeatedly over these areas. The air mass was most unstable on the 8th, where several severe thunderstorms developed and produced wind damage across portions of Northwest and North Central Louisiana, as well as East Texas. However, widespread heavy rainfall was relentless along and ahead of the surface front over Deep East Texas, all of North Louisiana, and Southwest Arkansas where widespread flash flooding occurred. Widespread rainfall amounts of 12-18 inches fell during the 4 day period across Deep East Texas and all of North Louisiana, with amounts in excess of 24 inches across Ouachita Parish. This flooding was of epic proportions across the entire northern half of the state, something the Emergency Management community said they have never experienced before.  Thousands of structures suffered some sort of water damage along with thousands of road surfaces as well.  Many road surfaces, bridges and low water crossings were completely washed out.  This resulted in many high water rescues of stranded motorists, especially during the very beginnings of the prolonged flooding event.  Many motorists drove around barricades and into the flooded roadways.  The flash flooding event very quickly transitioned into a historic hydrologic event as several rivers, lakes and bayous suffered major flooding conditions with many reaching record crests.  This of course resulted in a daily watch of numerous levees and dams for North Louisiana's waterways with numerous subdivisions built in the vicinity of these waterways.  The Louisiana National Guard was dispatched by the Governor of Louisiana to help respond to the needs of citizens of North Louisiana which included evacuation assistance, rescues by vehicle, boat and helicopter, distribution and supply of water, security and shelter support and distribution of sandbags.  Numerous shelters were opened by the Louisiana Red Cross and by local churches across the northern half of the state as well to shelter residents effected by the flood.  A Federal Disaster Declaration was approved for Bienville, Bossier, Caddo, Caldwell, Claiborne, De Soto, Grant, Jackson, La Salle, Lincoln, Natchitoches, Ouachita, Red River, Sabine, Union, Webster and Winn Parishes.  Some of the more impressive 5-Day rainfall totals were as follows:  Monroe 3.2 SSE:  26.96, Taylortown: 20.39, Rocky Branch 1.3 W: 20.29, Barksdale AFB: 19.09, Minden: 18.73 Ruston 5.5 NW:  18.02, Hodges Gardens: 17.90, Natchitoches: 16.86, Jamestown: 16.85, Caney RAWS: 16.08, Gum Springs RAWS: 15.52, Quitman: 15.50, Stonewall: 15.42, South Southern Hills: 14.88, Columbia 4.1 NNW: 14.77, Coushatta 1.4 E: 14.21, Jena: 11.27, Catahoula RAWS: 8.69.","A 5-day heavy rainfall event resulted in massive flooding across all of Caldwell Parish in Northern Louisiana. Some of the more impressive 5 day totals across the parish were as follows: Columbia 4.1 NNW: 14.77, Columbia Lock and Dam: 9.60. The Louisiana National Guard was deployed by the Governor of Louisiana to assist local law enforcement in the massive response to the prolonged flooding event. These operations included evacuations, search and rescue, distribution and supply of water and meals, security and shelter support and distribution of sandbags and sandbag filling machines. In addition, 36 high water vehicles and 16 boats were called in to assist in the effort. Numerous roads were inundated and closed with flood waters during the height of the event across Caldwell Parish. Numerous high water rescues were conducted by first responders which included rescuing occupants trapped in their vehicles as well as the rescuing of residents from flooded homes across the parish.  The Ouachita River saw a significant rise and crest to 68.4 feet at the Columbia Lock and Dam as a result of the excessive heavy rainfall.  The Governor's Office of Homeland Security determined that upwards of 220 homes across Caldwell Parish were completely flooded with 731 homes having registered some sort of flood damage from the 5-day event.  Public property damage estimates were upwards of 4 million dollars.  Several Red Cross shelters were set up across the parish for flooded residents.

Strong westerly upper-level winds associated with the upper-level low over Illinois provided ample wind shear for supercells. A southwest wind flow of moist and unstable air in the lower levels of the atmosphere provided fuel for the storms. Low-level winds up to around 40 knots enhanced low-level wind shear, providing a favorable environment for tornadoes.

Rainfall measurements of 2 to 4 inches were common in these areas.  A retired NWS Lubbock employee in southwest Lubbock measured 5 inches and reported knee-deep water in his backyard. In addition to washing out large expanses of farmers' newly seeded fields, flooding stranded dozens of cars in southwest Lubbock alone.  Many southwest Lubbock businesses, including the South Plains Mall, closed early for the day due to impassable streets and flooded parking lots.  Several hundred homes suffered significant water damage to carpets and personal property.  Additionally, funnel clouds accompanied a few of these slow moving storms.  One motorist photographed a short-lived tornado north of Brownfield over open land around 1020 CST.  Economic losses and property damage from the flooding would likely reach several million USD.","Law enforcement reported significant flooding of streets and roads in west and southwest Lubbock - many of which had swiftly flowing water of a foot or more over them.  Several playa lakes overflowed their banks and inundated homes, vehicles, and businesses.  No injuries were reported, however some motorists required rescuing from water depths as great as five feet deep.  Some streets and roads were closed for 18 hours due to standing water.",CSV

As a result, severe thunderstorms developed across Rosebud, Custer and Fallon Counties. These thunderstorms produced very large hail, damaging wind gusts, as well as a tornado.","The pre-storm environment for eastern Montana was such that severe weather was likely. Surface dew point values in the Baker area were in the lower 60s with strong southeasterly flow converging in the vicinity of a stationary surface trough. This area of strong surface convergence, which also separated moist rich air to the east and drier air to the west, played a critical role in the development of this short-lived tornado. ||Although no fatalities occurred , seven injuries, some requiring hospitalization, resulted from the tornado. Two homes were totally destroyed and 40 to 50 more sustained excessive damage. The city blocks located between South 5th Street East and South 10th Street East intersected by Texas Avenue were hit the hardest and sustained the most damage. Many power poles were broken resulting in power lines down and power outages.

There were 15 fatalities in Greenbrier County and widespread catastrophic damage across much of the county. Summers and Monroe counties had much less severe flash flooding. ||The two days prior to the event were quite wet as several rounds of thunderstorms traversed the area with rainfall of roughly 1 to 2 inches across much of Greenbrier County in the 48 hours ending at 0800 EDT on June 23rd. This left the ground quite moist and primed for more efficient runoff.  The synoptic setup for this event featured an upper level ridge over the central U.S. northwest flow across the eastern U.S. Several strong short-waves topped the ridge and dropped southeast across the Ohio Valley toward the central Appalachians with the strongest wave approaching on the morning of the 23rd of June. Satellite imagery showed a deep tap of tropical moisture into West Virginia and a strengthening upper level jet providing additional lift. A warm front was located just north of the area and became a focus for convection in the early morning hours of the 23rd. Up to an inch of rain had fallen across Summers and Greenbrier by 730 AM EDT. Late in the morning, renewed convection from the west entered the area. During the late morning to early afternoon convection continued to train across the same general area of southeast WV and far western VA with hourly rainfall rates of 1.50 to 2. One of the more reliable automated rain gauges at White Sulphur Springs, WV (SUPW2) measured 2.32 and 1.89 in consecutive hours from 1 to 3 PM EDT or 4.21 in 2 hours. The 2-hour, 1000-year ARI at this location per NOAA Atlas 14 is 3.88??? giving an indication of the intensity of the rain.   Toward the end of this time window is when intense flash flooding began across eastern parts of the county but earlier in the far west. Flash Flood Warnings (FFWs) were issued throughout the morning and afternoon and a rare Flash Flood Warning Emergency product was issued  for Greenbrier County by the NWS at 441 PM EDT as the extent of the disaster became apparent. ||Radar and rain gauge measurements showed as much as 8 to 10 inches (perhaps higher locally) fell in a band across central Greenbrier County. The bulk of the rain fell in less than 12 hours between 600 AM and 600 PM. The top five official rain gauge totals (24-hour amounts ending at 8 AM EDT, June 24th) included White Sulphur Springs COOP (WSUW2) 8.29, Lewisburg 3N COOP (LWBW2) 8.00, White Sulphur Springs DCP (SUPW2) 7.83, McCross 3E COOP (MCRW2) 6.54 and Williamsburg VFD IFLOWS (WMBW2) 5.37.  One personal weather station at Maxwelton measured 9.37 and there were several anecdotal reports of 10 or more inches. The 24-hour rainfall at White Sulphur Springs COOP, with fairly complete data back to around 1920 (and sporadic  back to 1888) was more than double the all-time daily record (4.00??? set in March, 1890). Lewisburg 3N COOP with data all the way back to around 1900 also demolished its all-time daily record of 4.06??? set in July, 1954. A point event analysis by the Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center (HDSC) indicated that the rainfall was in the .001 Annual Exceedance Probability (1,000 year Annual Recurrence Interval, or ARI) for a 24-hour period.||The gauged hydrologic response was astounding as small creeks fed rivers that rose almost like a flash flood. An IFLOWS river gage at Ronceverte (RONW2) on the Greenbrier River rose to flood stage of 15 feet by around 730 PM EDT and climbed another 8.2 feet by 1130 PM. The NWS forecast point on Greenbrier River at Alderson (ALDW2) rose very slowly through the afternoon of the 23rd but around 700 PM EDT massive runoff began reaching the USGS gage location. The river rose from just over 4 feet (discharge of 2,300 cfs or cubic ft. per second) at 700 PM to reach flood stage of 14 feet (40,000 cfs) just 2.5 hours later around 930 PM. The river continued an astronomical rate of rise reaching Major Flood Stage (19 feet, 63,000 cfs) by midnight June 24th, before cresting at 22 feet (80,700 cfs) at 430 AM EDT. This was the 3rd highest crest on record (data back to 1895) at Alderson, surpassed only by the January 1996 rain/snowmelt flood and November 1985 flood. According to the latest available USGS report on flood frequency for West Virginia streams the discharge at the Alderson gage was very close to the 0.01 Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) or 100-year annual recurrence interval. A similar extreme response occurred on the Greenbrier River at the Hilldale USGS gage (HLLW2) downstream of Alderson just above the confluence with the New River. It also had its 3rd highest crest (25.45 feet, Flood Stage 16 ft) and discharge (82,508 cfs) on record (data back to 1936) and was also very close to the .01 AEP or 100-year event.","Unprecedented flash flooding occurred across large parts of Greenbrier County but especially in a swath across the central part of the county where an estimated 6 to 10 inches of rain fell in less than 12 hours. The first flood-related report was received at 100 PM EDT (1200 PM EST) as a portion of Highway 20 in western Greenbrier County became impassable south of Quinwood due to a mudslide and debris in the road. By 130 PM (1230 EST) there were several reports of flash flooding in the community of Rupert which required the evacuation of a nursing home and a vehicle rescue. Portions of Route 60 were closed between Rainelle and Rupert and severe flash flooding occurred along Big Clear Creek, a tributary of the Meadow River just north of Rupert. A number of homes of homes were badly damaged or destroyed along Big Clear Creek and several water rescues required in the Rupert area. The first flooding reports out of Rainelle in far western Greenbrier County were received at 155 PM (1255 EDT) and described people being trapped in cars and numerous water rescues. Several creeks emerge from the higher terrain surrounding Rainelle and converge in or near the town (Wolfpen Creek, Boggs Creek, Little Sewell Creek), the largest of which is Sewell Creek which then joins the Meadow River just northeast of town. The IFLOWS gage on the Meadow River near Hines (HNEW2) rose rapidly above its Flood Stage of 14 feet by 200 PM EDT and reached Major Flood Stage of 18 feet just two hours later, shortly before it ceased functioning at a stage of 18.8 feet while still rising. Flooding along the Meadow River was extensive with numerous homes and businesses affected. In addition, the rising Meadow River prevented Sewell Creek in Rainelle from discharging into the Meadow River which likely contributed to the rapidly rising water levels in Rainelle. Flooding was catastrophic in the town with water up to 8 feet deep or more and numerous homes flooded. There were four fatalities in Rainelle and three in Rupert, all due to asphyxiation (drowning). ||Meanwhile, numerous flood reports continued to be received although the 911 center and Emergency Management were completely overwhelmed with calls. The Greenbrier County Sheriff described 'complete chaos' across the county in a media report as dozens of roads were closed, damaged or destroyed and many water rescues were made from cars and structures. Especially hard hit was the White Sulphur Springs area in the eastern part of the county. Several small streams also descend rapidly from higher surrounding terrain and converge in or near White Sulphur Springs including Dry Creek and Wades Creek which join Howard Creek in the town, which itself is a large tributary of the Greenbrier River. All were transformed into raging torrents which tore through parts of the town taking trees, cars and even homes downstream. One of the more horrifying images was of a burning home being carried downstream on Howard Creek before colliding with a bridge. This creek runs through portions of the famous Greenbrier Resort and images of the normally tranquil stream converted into a massive river covering portions of the golf course were widely shared on social and conventional media. Howard Creek flooded long stretches of U.S. Highway 60 downstream of White Sulphur Springs, causing severe damage all along the way to its confluence with the Greenbrier River at Caldwell, six miles downstream. Parts of Route 60 were essentially destroyed and probably dozens of cars were swept into the creek and deposited along the way. There were seven fatalities in and around the White Sulphur Springs area, all but one from drowning. One person's body was found some 30 miles downstream on the Greenbrier River from where she was believed to have been swept into a creek that feeds the river. The body of a teenage girl from White Sulphur Springs was not found for over 6 weeks, eventually winding up in the Caldwell area on the Greenbrier River. There was significant flooding all along the Greenbrier River with Caldwell, Ronceverte and Alderson the hardest hit as the river rose at near flash-flood rates and crested in the Major Flood category (see Episode for details). Numerous homes were flooded in the town of Alderson (Pop: 1184), according to the Mayor. A state of emergency was declared for a number of counties in West Virginia during and after the event and a Major Federal Disaster for over  dozen counties was declared on June 25, 2016 by the President of the U.S. Fatalities in the county totaled 15 with an unknown number of injuries. There was over $5.5 million in public road/bridge damage in Greenbrier County and substantial damage to private roads and bridges. Preliminary data showed 319 homes destroyed and 353 damaged across the county, mostly in the Rainelle and White Sulphur Springs areas. In addition, 12 businesses were destroyed and 20 damaged along with numerous motor vehicles destroyed. Final damage totals for the event are not available from Emergency Management officials as of this writing but an estimate $40 million may not be unreasonable.",CSV

Flash flooding on small streams turned into river flooding. A historic and record setting flood occurred along portions of the Elk and Gauley Rivers in central West Virginia.  Less significant flooding occurred on the perimeter of the hardest hit area.||The initial convective complex developed during the evening hours of the 22nd near Chicago.  The complex reached southeast Ohio just after 0000E on the 23d, while a surface warm front was returning northeast into West Virginia.  A few renegade storms even formed ahead of the complex along the warm front.  ||The first round of convection entered West Virginia around 0100E on the 23rd. It crossed West Virginia during the predawn hours with downpours and gusty winds. Within this initial round of convection, a brief tornado was confirmed in Jackson County. Also, a microburst was surveyed just south of Birch River in Nicholas County. ||The first complex exited the eastern counties of the state a few hours after dawn.  Yet, the undisturbed southwest low level flow, of moisture rich air, allowed new convection to form in its wake.  These new showers and storms formed in the mid Ohio Valley from southern Ohio eastward toward the Huntington and Charleston vicinity. These thunderstorms moved back east, across central West Virginia during the late morning and midday time frame.  In the muggy air, additional storms formed during the afternoon and early evening hours.  The rains finally diminished after 1900E on the 23rd.  The total duration of these multiple rounds of convective showers and storms encompassed no more than 18 hours.||A 2 to 4 inch rain maximum occurred with the initial convective complex.  This initial rain maximum ran from near Parkersburg on up the Little Kanawha River Valley to near Glenville and through Upshur Counties.  Other heavier bands were in Lewis and Harrison Counties. For example, by 0900E, Pullman in Ritchie County and Spurgeon in Gilmer County both measured 3.76 inches. Harrisville in Ritchie County measured 3.48 inches of rain. Willow Island on the Ohio River measure 3.38 inches. French Creek had 3.4 inches of rain.  The cooperative observer at Clarksburg measured 3.30 inches, Stonewall Jackson Lake in Lewis County had 3.05 inches and Rock Cave measured 2.8 inches of rain.  In terms of rain rates, the Clarksburg airport in Bridgeport had .5 inches of rain in just 8 minutes, with 1.36 inches of rain in about 40 minutes.  Minor flash flooding occurred with this initial convective band during the predawn and dawn time frame.  Less rains fell further south.  For example, Big Chimney in Kanawha County had 1.76 inches by 0900E. ||The new convection that formed during the morning of the 23rd, saw its heavier rain fall south of the initial band.  The rain axis went from Jackson County on southeast into Clay and Nicholas Counties.  By 1200E, Poe North in Nicholas County had 4.52 inches of rain, Laurel Ridge in Clay county had a 3.72 inches total, and Muddlety in Nicholas County measured a 3.31 inch rain total.||After the third and fourth rounds of convection during the afternoon and evening, a 4 to 7.5 inch rainfall maximum occurred in less than 18 hours. The axis of this maximum rain went from Jackson County on southeast through Roane, northern Kanawha, Clay, Nicholas, Webster, into southern Pocahontas. The rain maximum continued into central Greenbrier County, which is handled by the Blacksburg office of the National Weather Service.  This elongated heavy rain axis was oriented on a compass heading from around 305 degrees to 125 degrees. The width of the heavy rain area went from around 30 miles near the Ohio River to about 50 miles in the central mountain counties.  A key ingredient to this disaster was the fact that less than 2 days earlier, 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain had fallen over parts of Clay, Webster, and Nicholas Counties. As a result, a higher percentage of the rain on the 23rd went directly into runoff than usual.     ||Here are the maximum measured storm rain totals.  Laurel Ridge in Clay County measured 7.21 inches of rain.  A volunteer observer in Runa of Nichalas County had 7.2 inches. Along the county line with Clay and Kanawha Counties, Queen Shoals measured 7.12 inches of rain.  Birch River had 5.81 inches, Summersville 5.65 inches, Craigsville 5.63 inches, Richwood 5.53 inches, Sutton 5.47 inches, Hacker Valley 5.06 inches, Sissonville 4.02 inches, Snowshoe 3.97 inches, and Spencer 3.74 inches. An automatic gauge west of Summersville Lake near Keslers Cross Lanes measured 6.16 inches. At one point during the afternoon, this gauge measured 1.1 inches of rain in just 15 minutes.  A gauge near the headwaters of Beach Fork in western Nicholas County measured 5.5 inches of rain.   An unofficial rain gauge at a coal company near Werth of Nicholas County measured a 6.6 inch rain total.        |  |Severe flash flooding occurred on the creeks and streams during the later rounds of showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon. This was quickly followed by river flooding on the Greenbrier, Elk, and Gauley Rivers. This included the smaller tributaries such as the Williams River and the Meadow River in the Gauley River basin, plus the Birch River in the Elk River basin.  Fatalities occurred in Kanawha and Jackson Counties. Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties. ||Record stages were set on the upper Gauley River.  Dyer on the Williams River rose 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd and crested at 20.78 feet around 1915E.  The previous record level at Dyer was 18.45 feet back on July 4th in 1932.  The flooding in Richwood was as much from the runoff off the steep mountainsides flowing rapidly down through the streets, as it was from the overflowing Cherry River.  Laurel Creek, a tributary of the Cherry River, near Fenwick crested at 12.34 feet around 2000E.   On the main stem of the Gauley River, Craigsville crested at 29.04 feet after rising 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd.   At one point between 1400 and 1500E the river rose 3 feet in 1 hour.  The crest time was 2200E on the 23rd at Craigsville.  The previous record was 25.94 feet back in November of 2003.  The crest at Camden on Gauley was above the level of the instrument shelf table in the river stage well house.  Of course, this caused the instruments to fail.  Before failure, the river was rising nearly 3 feet per hour.  In the wake of the flood, the well defined high water mark was used to calculated the crest.  After a vertical rise of around 24 feet, the crest at Camden on Gauley was 29.75 feet near 2145E on the 23rd. The previous record was 27.38 feet, back on July 4th in 1932.  In the town of Camden on Gauley, the high water mark was 7 feet high on buildings.  While holding the discharge down, the Corps of Engineers saw Summersville Lake rise 41 feet in the vertical during this flood.||Below Summersville Dam a huge discharge was noted from the Meadow River into the lower Gauley River.  The surge of water coming from western Greenbrier County caused the lower Meadow River at Nallen to rise 19.5 feet in the vertical and crest at 24.50 feet at 2015E on the 23rd. The previous record crest at Nallen was 16.94 feet back in December of 1969.  Further down the Gauley River, despite Summersville Dam holding back much of the outflow from the upper Gauley basin, the gauge at Belva still rose 22 feet in the vertical in less than 18 hours.  Belva crested at 27.04 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This crest was the 2nd highest on record. The 5th of July crest in 1932, well prior to the dam, was 28.6 feet at Belva.  One resident near Belva said of the river flood, ???It just kind of looked like the ocean, and it just swarmed in. And it just didn???t go back.???||In the upper Elk River basin, the gauge below Webster Springs at Clifton Ford crested at 17.36 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This was not a record crest, but the highest since the start of the 20th century.  Herold on the Birch River, after rising 15 feet in the vertical, crested at 18.03 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  The previous record was 13.7 feet in December 2013.      ||On the lower Elk River, below the Corps of Engineers flood control dam at Sutton, the water level at Clay rose 26 feet in the vertical during the 23rd, at a rate as high as 3 feet per hour.  The crest was at 30.3 feet around 2145E on the 23rd.  This was the 3rd highest crest on record for Clay, and the highest since 1918. Further down the river at Queen Shoals, just above Clendenin, the water level rose 27 feet in the vertical, at a rate as high as 2.5 feet per hour. The crest was 33.37 feet around 0445E on the 24th.  This was the highest on record for Queen Shoals. The previous record was 32 feet back in 1888. The high water mark was 5 feet high on buildings in downtown Clendenin.  A similar high water mark was noted across the Elk River in the large grocery store.  ||In comparison to the Elk and Gauley drainage, the river flooding on the Greenbrier River in Pocahontas County was minor.  The headwaters of the Greenbrier River were north of the heavy rain axis.  The crest in Marlinton was 12 feet during the late evening of the 23rd, with flood stage at 10 feet.  Further down the river, the level at Buckeye crested just below the 12 foot flood stage.  ||The flash floods and river floods caused fatalities in Kanawha and Jackson Counties.  Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, or Pocahontas Counties. Severe damage and destruction of homes, businesses, and schools occurred. Roads were damaged.

Some of the storms became severe with numerous reports of large hail, some damaging winds and an EF2 tornado that occurred near Bourbon and Sullivan Missouri during the evening. The most costly damage occurred from a pair of supercells that dropped baseball to softball size hail across St. Charles County Missouri and produced severe wind gusts in St. Louis County and the City of St. Louis around the lunch hour.  There were also a few reports of flash flooding with these storms.","Very large hail up to 4 inches in diameter fell across portions of St. Charles County.  The hardest hit areas stretched from near Dardenne Prairie, O'Fallon and Weldon Spring east to Cottleville, St. Peters and St. Charles.   Damage from this hail storm will be many millions of dollars as thousands of homes, vehicles and businesses were impacted and suffered damage.  One hundred twenty cars at a car dealership near the intersection of I-64/Highway 94, sustained busted windows and lots of dents from large hail, some that were as big as baseballs.

Flash flooding on small streams turned into river flooding. A historic and record setting flood occurred along portions of the Elk and Gauley Rivers in central West Virginia.  Less significant flooding occurred on the perimeter of the hardest hit area.||The initial convective complex developed during the evening hours of the 22nd near Chicago.  The complex reached southeast Ohio just after 0000E on the 23d, while a surface warm front was returning northeast into West Virginia.  A few renegade storms even formed ahead of the complex along the warm front.  ||The first round of convection entered West Virginia around 0100E on the 23rd. It crossed West Virginia during the predawn hours with downpours and gusty winds. Within this initial round of convection, a brief tornado was confirmed in Jackson County. Also, a microburst was surveyed just south of Birch River in Nicholas County. ||The first complex exited the eastern counties of the state a few hours after dawn.  Yet, the undisturbed southwest low level flow, of moisture rich air, allowed new convection to form in its wake.  These new showers and storms formed in the mid Ohio Valley from southern Ohio eastward toward the Huntington and Charleston vicinity. These thunderstorms moved back east, across central West Virginia during the late morning and midday time frame.  In the muggy air, additional storms formed during the afternoon and early evening hours.  The rains finally diminished after 1900E on the 23rd.  The total duration of these multiple rounds of convective showers and storms encompassed no more than 18 hours.||A 2 to 4 inch rain maximum occurred with the initial convective complex.  This initial rain maximum ran from near Parkersburg on up the Little Kanawha River Valley to near Glenville and through Upshur Counties.  Other heavier bands were in Lewis and Harrison Counties. For example, by 0900E, Pullman in Ritchie County and Spurgeon in Gilmer County both measured 3.76 inches. Harrisville in Ritchie County measured 3.48 inches of rain. Willow Island on the Ohio River measure 3.38 inches. French Creek had 3.4 inches of rain.  The cooperative observer at Clarksburg measured 3.30 inches, Stonewall Jackson Lake in Lewis County had 3.05 inches and Rock Cave measured 2.8 inches of rain.  In terms of rain rates, the Clarksburg airport in Bridgeport had .5 inches of rain in just 8 minutes, with 1.36 inches of rain in about 40 minutes.  Minor flash flooding occurred with this initial convective band during the predawn and dawn time frame.  Less rains fell further south.  For example, Big Chimney in Kanawha County had 1.76 inches by 0900E. ||The new convection that formed during the morning of the 23rd, saw its heavier rain fall south of the initial band.  The rain axis went from Jackson County on southeast into Clay and Nicholas Counties.  By 1200E, Poe North in Nicholas County had 4.52 inches of rain, Laurel Ridge in Clay county had a 3.72 inches total, and Muddlety in Nicholas County measured a 3.31 inch rain total.||After the third and fourth rounds of convection during the afternoon and evening, a 4 to 7.5 inch rainfall maximum occurred in less than 18 hours. The axis of this maximum rain went from Jackson County on southeast through Roane, northern Kanawha, Clay, Nicholas, Webster, into southern Pocahontas. The rain maximum continued into central Greenbrier County, which is handled by the Blacksburg office of the National Weather Service.  This elongated heavy rain axis was oriented on a compass heading from around 305 degrees to 125 degrees. The width of the heavy rain area went from around 30 miles near the Ohio River to about 50 miles in the central mountain counties.  A key ingredient to this disaster was the fact that less than 2 days earlier, 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain had fallen over parts of Clay, Webster, and Nicholas Counties. As a result, a higher percentage of the rain on the 23rd went directly into runoff than usual.     ||Here are the maximum measured storm rain totals.  Laurel Ridge in Clay County measured 7.21 inches of rain.  A volunteer observer in Runa of Nichalas County had 7.2 inches. Along the county line with Clay and Kanawha Counties, Queen Shoals measured 7.12 inches of rain.  Birch River had 5.81 inches, Summersville 5.65 inches, Craigsville 5.63 inches, Richwood 5.53 inches, Sutton 5.47 inches, Hacker Valley 5.06 inches, Sissonville 4.02 inches, Snowshoe 3.97 inches, and Spencer 3.74 inches. An automatic gauge west of Summersville Lake near Keslers Cross Lanes measured 6.16 inches. At one point during the afternoon, this gauge measured 1.1 inches of rain in just 15 minutes.  A gauge near the headwaters of Beach Fork in western Nicholas County measured 5.5 inches of rain.   An unofficial rain gauge at a coal company near Werth of Nicholas County measured a 6.6 inch rain total.        |  |Severe flash flooding occurred on the creeks and streams during the later rounds of showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon. This was quickly followed by river flooding on the Greenbrier, Elk, and Gauley Rivers. This included the smaller tributaries such as the Williams River and the Meadow River in the Gauley River basin, plus the Birch River in the Elk River basin.  Fatalities occurred in Kanawha and Jackson Counties. Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties. ||Record stages were set on the upper Gauley River.  Dyer on the Williams River rose 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd and crested at 20.78 feet around 1915E.  The previous record level at Dyer was 18.45 feet back on July 4th in 1932.  The flooding in Richwood was as much from the runoff off the steep mountainsides flowing rapidly down through the streets, as it was from the overflowing Cherry River.  Laurel Creek, a tributary of the Cherry River, near Fenwick crested at 12.34 feet around 2000E.   On the main stem of the Gauley River, Craigsville crested at 29.04 feet after rising 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd.   At one point between 1400 and 1500E the river rose 3 feet in 1 hour.  The crest time was 2200E on the 23rd at Craigsville.  The previous record was 25.94 feet back in November of 2003.  The crest at Camden on Gauley was above the level of the instrument shelf table in the river stage well house.  Of course, this caused the instruments to fail.  Before failure, the river was rising nearly 3 feet per hour.  In the wake of the flood, the well defined high water mark was used to calculated the crest.  After a vertical rise of around 24 feet, the crest at Camden on Gauley was 29.75 feet near 2145E on the 23rd. The previous record was 27.38 feet, back on July 4th in 1932.  In the town of Camden on Gauley, the high water mark was 7 feet high on buildings.  While holding the discharge down, the Corps of Engineers saw Summersville Lake rise 41 feet in the vertical during this flood.||Below Summersville Dam a huge discharge was noted from the Meadow River into the lower Gauley River.  The surge of water coming from western Greenbrier County caused the lower Meadow River at Nallen to rise 19.5 feet in the vertical and crest at 24.50 feet at 2015E on the 23rd. The previous record crest at Nallen was 16.94 feet back in December of 1969.  Further down the Gauley River, despite Summersville Dam holding back much of the outflow from the upper Gauley basin, the gauge at Belva still rose 22 feet in the vertical in less than 18 hours.  Belva crested at 27.04 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This crest was the 2nd highest on record. The 5th of July crest in 1932, well prior to the dam, was 28.6 feet at Belva.  One resident near Belva said of the river flood, ???It just kind of looked like the ocean, and it just swarmed in. And it just didn???t go back.???||In the upper Elk River basin, the gauge below Webster Springs at Clifton Ford crested at 17.36 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This was not a record crest, but the highest since the start of the 20th century.  Herold on the Birch River, after rising 15 feet in the vertical, crested at 18.03 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  The previous record was 13.7 feet in December 2013.      ||On the lower Elk River, below the Corps of Engineers flood control dam at Sutton, the water level at Clay rose 26 feet in the vertical during the 23rd, at a rate as high as 3 feet per hour.  The crest was at 30.3 feet around 2145E on the 23rd.  This was the 3rd highest crest on record for Clay, and the highest since 1918. Further down the river at Queen Shoals, just above Clendenin, the water level rose 27 feet in the vertical, at a rate as high as 2.5 feet per hour. The crest was 33.37 feet around 0445E on the 24th.  This was the highest on record for Queen Shoals. The previous record was 32 feet back in 1888. The high water mark was 5 feet high on buildings in downtown Clendenin.  A similar high water mark was noted across the Elk River in the large grocery store.  ||In comparison to the Elk and Gauley drainage, the river flooding on the Greenbrier River in Pocahontas County was minor.  The headwaters of the Greenbrier River were north of the heavy rain axis.  The crest in Marlinton was 12 feet during the late evening of the 23rd, with flood stage at 10 feet.  Further down the river, the level at Buckeye crested just below the 12 foot flood stage.  ||The flash floods and river floods caused fatalities in Kanawha and Jackson Counties.  Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, or Pocahontas Counties. Severe damage and destruction of homes, businesses, and schools occurred. Roads were damaged.

Over 4900 individuals applied for federal assistance from those 8 counties, totaling over 20 million dollars.  Public assistance for debris removal, emergency protective services, roads, bridges, and schools, was over 50 million dollar in those same 8 counties.","Severe flash flooding occurred in scattered locations along several streams.  One stream was Porter Creek in the Bomont area. One 9 year resident in Bomont said, I really do not imagine how this would happen. It's just heartbreaking to see all the homes floating down the creek.  A few of the other streams included Laurel Creek near Paxton and Big Otter near Ivydale.||This initial flash flooding along the small streams transitioned into river flooding along the Elk River.",CSV

Flash flooding on small streams turned into river flooding. A historic and record setting flood occurred along portions of the Elk and Gauley Rivers in central West Virginia.  Less significant flooding occurred on the perimeter of the hardest hit area.||The initial convective complex developed during the evening hours of the 22nd near Chicago.  The complex reached southeast Ohio just after 0000E on the 23d, while a surface warm front was returning northeast into West Virginia.  A few renegade storms even formed ahead of the complex along the warm front.  ||The first round of convection entered West Virginia around 0100E on the 23rd. It crossed West Virginia during the predawn hours with downpours and gusty winds. Within this initial round of convection, a brief tornado was confirmed in Jackson County. Also, a microburst was surveyed just south of Birch River in Nicholas County. ||The first complex exited the eastern counties of the state a few hours after dawn.  Yet, the undisturbed southwest low level flow, of moisture rich air, allowed new convection to form in its wake.  These new showers and storms formed in the mid Ohio Valley from southern Ohio eastward toward the Huntington and Charleston vicinity. These thunderstorms moved back east, across central West Virginia during the late morning and midday time frame.  In the muggy air, additional storms formed during the afternoon and early evening hours.  The rains finally diminished after 1900E on the 23rd.  The total duration of these multiple rounds of convective showers and storms encompassed no more than 18 hours.||A 2 to 4 inch rain maximum occurred with the initial convective complex.  This initial rain maximum ran from near Parkersburg on up the Little Kanawha River Valley to near Glenville and through Upshur Counties.  Other heavier bands were in Lewis and Harrison Counties. For example, by 0900E, Pullman in Ritchie County and Spurgeon in Gilmer County both measured 3.76 inches. Harrisville in Ritchie County measured 3.48 inches of rain. Willow Island on the Ohio River measure 3.38 inches. French Creek had 3.4 inches of rain.  The cooperative observer at Clarksburg measured 3.30 inches, Stonewall Jackson Lake in Lewis County had 3.05 inches and Rock Cave measured 2.8 inches of rain.  In terms of rain rates, the Clarksburg airport in Bridgeport had .5 inches of rain in just 8 minutes, with 1.36 inches of rain in about 40 minutes.  Minor flash flooding occurred with this initial convective band during the predawn and dawn time frame.  Less rains fell further south.  For example, Big Chimney in Kanawha County had 1.76 inches by 0900E. ||The new convection that formed during the morning of the 23rd, saw its heavier rain fall south of the initial band.  The rain axis went from Jackson County on southeast into Clay and Nicholas Counties.  By 1200E, Poe North in Nicholas County had 4.52 inches of rain, Laurel Ridge in Clay county had a 3.72 inches total, and Muddlety in Nicholas County measured a 3.31 inch rain total.||After the third and fourth rounds of convection during the afternoon and evening, a 4 to 7.5 inch rainfall maximum occurred in less than 18 hours. The axis of this maximum rain went from Jackson County on southeast through Roane, northern Kanawha, Clay, Nicholas, Webster, into southern Pocahontas. The rain maximum continued into central Greenbrier County, which is handled by the Blacksburg office of the National Weather Service.  This elongated heavy rain axis was oriented on a compass heading from around 305 degrees to 125 degrees. The width of the heavy rain area went from around 30 miles near the Ohio River to about 50 miles in the central mountain counties.  A key ingredient to this disaster was the fact that less than 2 days earlier, 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain had fallen over parts of Clay, Webster, and Nicholas Counties. As a result, a higher percentage of the rain on the 23rd went directly into runoff than usual.     ||Here are the maximum measured storm rain totals.  Laurel Ridge in Clay County measured 7.21 inches of rain.  A volunteer observer in Runa of Nichalas County had 7.2 inches. Along the county line with Clay and Kanawha Counties, Queen Shoals measured 7.12 inches of rain.  Birch River had 5.81 inches, Summersville 5.65 inches, Craigsville 5.63 inches, Richwood 5.53 inches, Sutton 5.47 inches, Hacker Valley 5.06 inches, Sissonville 4.02 inches, Snowshoe 3.97 inches, and Spencer 3.74 inches. An automatic gauge west of Summersville Lake near Keslers Cross Lanes measured 6.16 inches. At one point during the afternoon, this gauge measured 1.1 inches of rain in just 15 minutes.  A gauge near the headwaters of Beach Fork in western Nicholas County measured 5.5 inches of rain.   An unofficial rain gauge at a coal company near Werth of Nicholas County measured a 6.6 inch rain total.        |  |Severe flash flooding occurred on the creeks and streams during the later rounds of showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon. This was quickly followed by river flooding on the Greenbrier, Elk, and Gauley Rivers. This included the smaller tributaries such as the Williams River and the Meadow River in the Gauley River basin, plus the Birch River in the Elk River basin.  Fatalities occurred in Kanawha and Jackson Counties. Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties. ||Record stages were set on the upper Gauley River.  Dyer on the Williams River rose 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd and crested at 20.78 feet around 1915E.  The previous record level at Dyer was 18.45 feet back on July 4th in 1932.  The flooding in Richwood was as much from the runoff off the steep mountainsides flowing rapidly down through the streets, as it was from the overflowing Cherry River.  Laurel Creek, a tributary of the Cherry River, near Fenwick crested at 12.34 feet around 2000E.   On the main stem of the Gauley River, Craigsville crested at 29.04 feet after rising 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd.   At one point between 1400 and 1500E the river rose 3 feet in 1 hour.  The crest time was 2200E on the 23rd at Craigsville.  The previous record was 25.94 feet back in November of 2003.  The crest at Camden on Gauley was above the level of the instrument shelf table in the river stage well house.  Of course, this caused the instruments to fail.  Before failure, the river was rising nearly 3 feet per hour.  In the wake of the flood, the well defined high water mark was used to calculated the crest.  After a vertical rise of around 24 feet, the crest at Camden on Gauley was 29.75 feet near 2145E on the 23rd. The previous record was 27.38 feet, back on July 4th in 1932.  In the town of Camden on Gauley, the high water mark was 7 feet high on buildings.  While holding the discharge down, the Corps of Engineers saw Summersville Lake rise 41 feet in the vertical during this flood.||Below Summersville Dam a huge discharge was noted from the Meadow River into the lower Gauley River.  The surge of water coming from western Greenbrier County caused the lower Meadow River at Nallen to rise 19.5 feet in the vertical and crest at 24.50 feet at 2015E on the 23rd. The previous record crest at Nallen was 16.94 feet back in December of 1969.  Further down the Gauley River, despite Summersville Dam holding back much of the outflow from the upper Gauley basin, the gauge at Belva still rose 22 feet in the vertical in less than 18 hours.  Belva crested at 27.04 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This crest was the 2nd highest on record. The 5th of July crest in 1932, well prior to the dam, was 28.6 feet at Belva.  One resident near Belva said of the river flood, ???It just kind of looked like the ocean, and it just swarmed in. And it just didn???t go back.???||In the upper Elk River basin, the gauge below Webster Springs at Clifton Ford crested at 17.36 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This was not a record crest, but the highest since the start of the 20th century.  Herold on the Birch River, after rising 15 feet in the vertical, crested at 18.03 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  The previous record was 13.7 feet in December 2013.      ||On the lower Elk River, below the Corps of Engineers flood control dam at Sutton, the water level at Clay rose 26 feet in the vertical during the 23rd, at a rate as high as 3 feet per hour.  The crest was at 30.3 feet around 2145E on the 23rd.  This was the 3rd highest crest on record for Clay, and the highest since 1918. Further down the river at Queen Shoals, just above Clendenin, the water level rose 27 feet in the vertical, at a rate as high as 2.5 feet per hour. The crest was 33.37 feet around 0445E on the 24th.  This was the highest on record for Queen Shoals. The previous record was 32 feet back in 1888. The high water mark was 5 feet high on buildings in downtown Clendenin.  A similar high water mark was noted across the Elk River in the large grocery store.  ||In comparison to the Elk and Gauley drainage, the river flooding on the Greenbrier River in Pocahontas County was minor.  The headwaters of the Greenbrier River were north of the heavy rain axis.  The crest in Marlinton was 12 feet during the late evening of the 23rd, with flood stage at 10 feet.  Further down the river, the level at Buckeye crested just below the 12 foot flood stage.  ||The flash floods and river floods caused fatalities in Kanawha and Jackson Counties.  Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, or Pocahontas Counties. Severe damage and destruction of homes, businesses, and schools occurred. Roads were damaged. In the worst cases, sections of road bed were washed away.  Public bridges and small private bridges were damaged or destroyed. Large debris piles collected against bridges. Countless vehicles were flooded.  Electricity and water were lost for days in the hardest hit flood areas.         ||The American Red Cross had over 800 workers helping at its peak.  They distributed over 7,500 cleanup kits and over 100,000 meals and snacks.  Many church based organizations and ordinary individual citizens volunteered their time and services to help in the flood recovery.  Nationally known celebrities and sport figures, with ties to West Virginia, also helped to raise awareness and increase donations for flood recovery.||The state transportation secretary estimated 8 million dollars in damage to roads in Clay County, 8 million dollars in Nicholas, over 13 million in Kanawha County.||Several schools were severely damaged by flood waters. This included in Clay County, White Elementary and the county bus garage. In Kanawha County, Herbert Hoover High School, Clendenin Elementary, Elk Valley Christian School, plus Bridge Elementary Schools were severely damaged.  Water from the Elk River crested about 7 feet deep in the first flood at Herbert Hoover High School. In Nicholas County. Richwood High and Middle School was severely damaged.  Moderate flood damage occurred to Clay High School and Elkview Middle School.  Minor flood damage occurred at Middle Birch Elementary School in Braxton County.  Minor flood damage also was seen in Ansted Elementary in Fayette County and Glade Elementary in Webster County.||A state of emergency was declared by Governor Tomblin.  At its peak deployment, around 650 members of the West Virginia Army National Guard and West Virginia Air National Guard were activated.  Major tasks assigned to the guard troops included delivering supplies to residents with no road access, and removal of flood debris.  Private contractors were also used for debris removal. In just Kanawha County, 15,000 tons of flood debris were collected.       ||A federal disaster was quickly declared by President Obama.  At least 8 counties were eligible from the events of June 23rd and 24th within the forecast area of the National Weather Service in Charleston.

The majority of severe storms targeted areas west of the Highway 281 corridor, mainly producing damaging winds and locally heavy rainfall/flooding, along with a few reports of large hail. Some of the more noteworthy wind and/or wind damage reports included: a measured 75 MPH gust in the Loomis area with power lines and trees down, measured gusts of 70 MPH near Norman and 68 MPH near Kearney, estimated 70 MPH winds in Beaver City and estimated 60 MPH winds in Lexington with 8-10 inch diameter tree limbs down. While most wind damage occurred between 7-9 p.m. CDT in close proximity to actual severe storms, strong to marginally-severe outflow winds managed to surge 20+ miles out ahead of the primary precipitation cores around sunset. This outflow yielded measured gusts around 50 MPH at the Grand Island and Hastings airports and even toppled a 10-inch diameter tree on the eastern fringe of Hastings. Later in the night, a completely separate, southward-rushing storm complex entered northeastern portions of the local area (counties mainly east of Highway 281 and along/north of Interstate 80) in a weakening state, but still produced northerly outflow of 50+ MPH, including 55 MPH measured at the York airport shortly after 1 a.m. CDT. There were fewer reports of large hail during this event, but stones up to golf ball size were confirmed near Ashton early in the evening, and also near Ord closer to sunset (quarter to ping pong ball size in Ord itself). ||Turning to hydrology issues, although they were fairly isolated/localized in nature, there were three bulls eyes of heavy, radar-estimated rainfall of at least 1.50-3.00 that fell in a short time and produced verified flooding. Going in chronological order, the first pocket of heavy rain targeted east-central Sherman County as a nearly-stationary storm parked itself overhead for roughly 2.5 hours between 4:30-7:00 p.m. CDT. This resulted in flooding of Deer Creek, which covered a portion of at least one rural road between Rockville and Ashton for a time. Around the time rain started easing up over Sherman County, additional pockets of short-fused heavy rain focused over portions of central Dawson and west-central Phelps counties mainly between 6:30-8:30 p.m. CDT, resulting in several county road closures in the Cozad/Lexington and Bertrand/Loomis areas. Although there were almost no official gauge totals from the very-heaviest rain zones, Lexington airport tallied 2.56. Outside of these three aforementioned pockets of very heavy rain, the majority of South Central Nebraska received no more than 0.50-1.00 during this event, and hardly even a drop within most central counties along the Highway 281 corridor.||Taking a closer look at timing, the first, isolated storms of the day flared up during the peak heating hours of 3-6 p.m. CDT, primarily within Sherman and Dawson counties. Then, during the ensuing four hours through 10 p.m. CDT, storm coverage greatly increased within the western half of South Central Nebraska, both as a result of new development along local outflow boundaries and also from additional storms expanding northeastward into the area out of southwest Nebraska and northwest Kansas. After 10 p.m. CDT, the onset of diurnal cooling resulted in a steady weakening/dissipation of the main round of afternoon/evening convection. However, primarily between 12-2 a.m. CDT on the 18th, a completely separate southward-tracking storm complex entered mainly northeastern portions of South Central Nebraska in a steadily-weakening state. Through the remainder of the night, scattered weak thunderstorms lingered over eastern portions of the area (especially within the Highway 81 counties), but by sunrise on the 18th nearly all of South Central Nebraska was rain-free. This was a somewhat sneaky severe weather event considering that mid-upper level forcing and deep-layer wind shear were quite weak by mid-June standards (no more than 15-20 knots), initially limiting the overall magnitude/coverage of severe storms. However, this lack of forcing/shear was clearly compensated for by a potent level of instability/CAPE, climbing to at least 3000-4000 J/kg during the afternoon. These lofty instability values were not surprising considering that this was one of the overall-hottest, most humid days of summer 2016 within South Central Nebraska as temperatures generally topped out 96-100 F in the presence of dewpoints in the mid-60s to low-70s. Because of this high instability/low shear setup, initially isolated multicell convection quickly became outflow-dominant, subsequently igniting increasingly-widespread storm development along a plethora of merging outflow boundaries. In the mid-upper levels, the weak flow and lack of large-scale forcing over the Central Plains was due to a broad ridge axis stretched from northern Mexico all the way into southeast Canada. At the surface, there were no pronounced boundaries of note over the local area, although a somewhat subtle inverted trough extended across Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast.","Quarter to golf ball size hail fell from a nearly stationary storm in the Ashton area.

There were 15 fatalities in Greenbrier County and widespread catastrophic damage across much of the county. Summers and Monroe counties had much less severe flash flooding. ||The two days prior to the event were quite wet as several rounds of thunderstorms traversed the area with rainfall of roughly 1 to 2 inches across much of Greenbrier County in the 48 hours ending at 0800 EDT on June 23rd. This left the ground quite moist and primed for more efficient runoff.  The synoptic setup for this event featured an upper level ridge over the central U.S. northwest flow across the eastern U.S. Several strong short-waves topped the ridge and dropped southeast across the Ohio Valley toward the central Appalachians with the strongest wave approaching on the morning of the 23rd of June. Satellite imagery showed a deep tap of tropical moisture into West Virginia and a strengthening upper level jet providing additional lift. A warm front was located just north of the area and became a focus for convection in the early morning hours of the 23rd. Up to an inch of rain had fallen across Summers and Greenbrier by 730 AM EDT. Late in the morning, renewed convection from the west entered the area. During the late morning to early afternoon convection continued to train across the same general area of southeast WV and far western VA with hourly rainfall rates of 1.50 to 2. One of the more reliable automated rain gauges at White Sulphur Springs, WV (SUPW2) measured 2.32 and 1.89 in consecutive hours from 1 to 3 PM EDT or 4.21 in 2 hours. The 2-hour, 1000-year ARI at this location per NOAA Atlas 14 is 3.88??? giving an indication of the intensity of the rain.   Toward the end of this time window is when intense flash flooding began across eastern parts of the county but earlier in the far west. Flash Flood Warnings (FFWs) were issued throughout the morning and afternoon and a rare Flash Flood Warning Emergency product was issued  for Greenbrier County by the NWS at 441 PM EDT as the extent of the disaster became apparent. ||Radar and rain gauge measurements showed as much as 8 to 10 inches (perhaps higher locally) fell in a band across central Greenbrier County. The bulk of the rain fell in less than 12 hours between 600 AM and 600 PM. The top five official rain gauge totals (24-hour amounts ending at 8 AM EDT, June 24th) included White Sulphur Springs COOP (WSUW2) 8.29, Lewisburg 3N COOP (LWBW2) 8.00, White Sulphur Springs DCP (SUPW2) 7.83, McCross 3E COOP (MCRW2) 6.54 and Williamsburg VFD IFLOWS (WMBW2) 5.37.  One personal weather station at Maxwelton measured 9.37 and there were several anecdotal reports of 10 or more inches. The 24-hour rainfall at White Sulphur Springs COOP, with fairly complete data back to around 1920 (and sporadic  back to 1888) was more than double the all-time daily record (4.00??? set in March, 1890). Lewisburg 3N COOP with data all the way back to around 1900 also demolished its all-time daily record of 4.06??? set in July, 1954. A point event analysis by the Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center (HDSC) indicated that the rainfall was in the .001 Annual Exceedance Probability (1,000 year Annual Recurrence Interval, or ARI) for a 24-hour period.||The gauged hydrologic response was astounding as small creeks fed rivers that rose almost like a flash flood. An IFLOWS river gage at Ronceverte (RONW2) on the Greenbrier River rose to flood stage of 15 feet by around 730 PM EDT and climbed another 8.2 feet by 1130 PM. The NWS forecast point on Greenbrier River at Alderson (ALDW2) rose very slowly through the afternoon of the 23rd but around 700 PM EDT massive runoff began reaching the USGS gage location. The river rose from just over 4 feet (discharge of 2,300 cfs or cubic ft. per second) at 700 PM to reach flood stage of 14 feet (40,000 cfs) just 2.5 hours later around 930 PM. The river continued an astronomical rate of rise reaching Major Flood Stage (19 feet, 63,000 cfs) by midnight June 24th, before cresting at 22 feet (80,700 cfs) at 430 AM EDT. This was the 3rd highest crest on record (data back to 1895) at Alderson, surpassed only by the January 1996 rain/snowmelt flood and November 1985 flood. According to the latest available USGS report on flood frequency for West Virginia streams the discharge at the Alderson gage was very close to the 0.01 Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) or 100-year annual recurrence interval. A similar extreme response occurred on the Greenbrier River at the Hilldale USGS gage (HLLW2) downstream of Alderson just above the confluence with the New River. It also had its 3rd highest crest (25.45 feet, Flood Stage 16 ft) and discharge (82,508 cfs) on record (data back to 1936) and was also very close to the .01 AEP or 100-year event.","Flash flooding was less severe in Summers County than in neighboring Greenbrier as rainfall was considerably less, ranging generally from 2 to 4 inches over the northeastern sections of the county. Still, initial surveys by emergency management show 190 homes (permanent) and 150 camps/rv's/trailers (seasonal) structures damaged or destroyed. The Greenbrier River which runs through the central part of the county, flooded into the Major category along its entire reach (see Episode for details) causing significant floodplain damage. The City of Hinton had street damage of up to $5,000 and County of Summers, Camp Summer had flood water up to 4 feet deep in most buildings, some damage to the pool, and other damage to fences and grounds.

The bulk of the rain fell in less than 12 hours between 600 AM and 600 PM EDT. The Governor of Virginia declared a state of emergency in the City of Covington and Alleghany County.||The phenomenal runoff from creeks, streams and overland flow produced an extreme hydrologic response on larger rivers including the Jackson River. The river gage at Covington (CVGV2) rose over 10 feet in 5 hours to reach Flood Stage (17 feet) for the first time since September 2004 (during the remains of Hurricane Jeanne).  A River Flood Warning (FLW) was issued at 609 PM as the river was near 15 feet and the crest was only 4.5 hours later at 22.33 feet just below the Major Flood Stage of 23 feet. This was highest stage reached at the Covington gage since the November 1985 flood (23.31 feet) and 2nd highest since the construction of Gathright Dam in 1979. Gathright Dam was built to reduce flooding on the Jackson River but so much rain fell in the watershed below the dam that flooding still occurred at Covington. Numerous homes and several businesses in Covington suffered severe flood damage from the Jackson River.  At the same time Dunlap Creek (DLPV2), which drains 162 mi2 of western Alleghany County and empties into the Jackson River in Covington was also rising at an extreme rate, climbing from a stage of around 3 feet (445 cfs) at 200 PM to a record stage of 16.49 feet (30,300 cfs) in a little over 6 hours.  The previous record at this gage was 15.65 feet (27,400 cfs) set in June 1972 with the remains of Hurricane Agnes. Hydrological peak stage records at this gage date back to 1929. According to USGS flood frequency reports this flood was likely in excess of a 200-year (0.005 AEP) event on Dunlap Creek. There was extensive flooding along Dunlap Creek with roads and homes flooded and some requiring evacuations. Flooding continued downstream and a few hours later a River Flood Warning was issued for the upper James River including the forecast points at Lick Run (LIRV2) and Buchanan (BNNV2) both of which easily reached flood stage. At Lick Run the crest of 22.84 feet was the 10th highest on record (continuous records since 1925) and the highest since January 1996 (25.03 feet).  Per USGS data the 48,000 cfs discharge at Lick Run was roughly a 10-year (.10 AEP) flood event. At Buchanan the 42,900 cfs was merely somewhere between a 2- to 5-year event (0.5 to 0.2 AEP).",Urban flooding was first reported from the City of Covington around 145 PM EDT (1245 EST) as two flood-prone underpasses were flooded. More serious flooding began around 230 PM EDT (130 PM EST) with numerous roads closed and eventually homes flooded. There was one boat rescue in Covington of a family trapped in a home with rising water. The rapidly rising Jackson River caused much of the flood damage in the city with up to 60 homes seriously damaged. A concrete plant lost $1.2 million in equipment and VDOT estimated $50 thousand in road damages within the city. There were also at least three landslides reported in the city.,CSV

Less significant flooding occurred on the perimeter of the hardest hit area.||The initial convective complex developed during the evening hours of the 22nd near Chicago.  The complex reached southeast Ohio just after 0000E on the 23d, while a surface warm front was returning northeast into West Virginia.  A few renegade storms even formed ahead of the complex along the warm front.  ||The first round of convection entered West Virginia around 0100E on the 23rd. It crossed West Virginia during the predawn hours with downpours and gusty winds. Within this initial round of convection, a brief tornado was confirmed in Jackson County. Also, a microburst was surveyed just south of Birch River in Nicholas County. ||The first complex exited the eastern counties of the state a few hours after dawn.  Yet, the undisturbed southwest low level flow, of moisture rich air, allowed new convection to form in its wake.  These new showers and storms formed in the mid Ohio Valley from southern Ohio eastward toward the Huntington and Charleston vicinity. These thunderstorms moved back east, across central West Virginia during the late morning and midday time frame.  In the muggy air, additional storms formed during the afternoon and early evening hours.  The rains finally diminished after 1900E on the 23rd.  The total duration of these multiple rounds of convective showers and storms encompassed no more than 18 hours.||A 2 to 4 inch rain maximum occurred with the initial convective complex.  This initial rain maximum ran from near Parkersburg on up the Little Kanawha River Valley to near Glenville and through Upshur Counties.  Other heavier bands were in Lewis and Harrison Counties. For example, by 0900E, Pullman in Ritchie County and Spurgeon in Gilmer County both measured 3.76 inches. Harrisville in Ritchie County measured 3.48 inches of rain. Willow Island on the Ohio River measure 3.38 inches. French Creek had 3.4 inches of rain.  The cooperative observer at Clarksburg measured 3.30 inches, Stonewall Jackson Lake in Lewis County had 3.05 inches and Rock Cave measured 2.8 inches of rain.  In terms of rain rates, the Clarksburg airport in Bridgeport had .5 inches of rain in just 8 minutes, with 1.36 inches of rain in about 40 minutes.  Minor flash flooding occurred with this initial convective band during the predawn and dawn time frame.  Less rains fell further south.  For example, Big Chimney in Kanawha County had 1.76 inches by 0900E. ||The new convection that formed during the morning of the 23rd, saw its heavier rain fall south of the initial band.  The rain axis went from Jackson County on southeast into Clay and Nicholas Counties.  By 1200E, Poe North in Nicholas County had 4.52 inches of rain, Laurel Ridge in Clay county had a 3.72 inches total, and Muddlety in Nicholas County measured a 3.31 inch rain total.||After the third and fourth rounds of convection during the afternoon and evening, a 4 to 7.5 inch rainfall maximum occurred in less than 18 hours. The axis of this maximum rain went from Jackson County on southeast through Roane, northern Kanawha, Clay, Nicholas, Webster, into southern Pocahontas. The rain maximum continued into central Greenbrier County, which is handled by the Blacksburg office of the National Weather Service.  This elongated heavy rain axis was oriented on a compass heading from around 305 degrees to 125 degrees. The width of the heavy rain area went from around 30 miles near the Ohio River to about 50 miles in the central mountain counties.  A key ingredient to this disaster was the fact that less than 2 days earlier, 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain had fallen over parts of Clay, Webster, and Nicholas Counties. As a result, a higher percentage of the rain on the 23rd went directly into runoff than usual.     ||Here are the maximum measured storm rain totals.  Laurel Ridge in Clay County measured 7.21 inches of rain.  A volunteer observer in Runa of Nichalas County had 7.2 inches. Along the county line with Clay and Kanawha Counties, Queen Shoals measured 7.12 inches of rain.  Birch River had 5.81 inches, Summersville 5.65 inches, Craigsville 5.63 inches, Richwood 5.53 inches, Sutton 5.47 inches, Hacker Valley 5.06 inches, Sissonville 4.02 inches, Snowshoe 3.97 inches, and Spencer 3.74 inches. An automatic gauge west of Summersville Lake near Keslers Cross Lanes measured 6.16 inches. At one point during the afternoon, this gauge measured 1.1 inches of rain in just 15 minutes.  A gauge near the headwaters of Beach Fork in western Nicholas County measured 5.5 inches of rain.   An unofficial rain gauge at a coal company near Werth of Nicholas County measured a 6.6 inch rain total.        |  |Severe flash flooding occurred on the creeks and streams during the later rounds of showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon. This was quickly followed by river flooding on the Greenbrier, Elk, and Gauley Rivers. This included the smaller tributaries such as the Williams River and the Meadow River in the Gauley River basin, plus the Birch River in the Elk River basin.  Fatalities occurred in Kanawha and Jackson Counties. Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties. ||Record stages were set on the upper Gauley River.  Dyer on the Williams River rose 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd and crested at 20.78 feet around 1915E.  The previous record level at Dyer was 18.45 feet back on July 4th in 1932.  The flooding in Richwood was as much from the runoff off the steep mountainsides flowing rapidly down through the streets, as it was from the overflowing Cherry River.  Laurel Creek, a tributary of the Cherry River, near Fenwick crested at 12.34 feet around 2000E.   On the main stem of the Gauley River, Craigsville crested at 29.04 feet after rising 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd.   At one point between 1400 and 1500E the river rose 3 feet in 1 hour.  The crest time was 2200E on the 23rd at Craigsville.  The previous record was 25.94 feet back in November of 2003.  The crest at Camden on Gauley was above the level of the instrument shelf table in the river stage well house.  Of course, this caused the instruments to fail.  Before failure, the river was rising nearly 3 feet per hour.  In the wake of the flood, the well defined high water mark was used to calculated the crest.  After a vertical rise of around 24 feet, the crest at Camden on Gauley was 29.75 feet near 2145E on the 23rd. The previous record was 27.38 feet, back on July 4th in 1932.  In the town of Camden on Gauley, the high water mark was 7 feet high on buildings.  While holding the discharge down, the Corps of Engineers saw Summersville Lake rise 41 feet in the vertical during this flood.||Below Summersville Dam a huge discharge was noted from the Meadow River into the lower Gauley River.  The surge of water coming from western Greenbrier County caused the lower Meadow River at Nallen to rise 19.5 feet in the vertical and crest at 24.50 feet at 2015E on the 23rd. The previous record crest at Nallen was 16.94 feet back in December of 1969.  Further down the Gauley River, despite Summersville Dam holding back much of the outflow from the upper Gauley basin, the gauge at Belva still rose 22 feet in the vertical in less than 18 hours.  Belva crested at 27.04 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This crest was the 2nd highest on record. The 5th of July crest in 1932, well prior to the dam, was 28.6 feet at Belva.  One resident near Belva said of the river flood, ???It just kind of looked like the ocean, and it just swarmed in. And it just didn???t go back.???||In the upper Elk River basin, the gauge below Webster Springs at Clifton Ford crested at 17.36 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This was not a record crest, but the highest since the start of the 20th century.  Herold on the Birch River, after rising 15 feet in the vertical, crested at 18.03 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  The previous record was 13.7 feet in December 2013.      ||On the lower Elk River, below the Corps of Engineers flood control dam at Sutton, the water level at Clay rose 26 feet in the vertical during the 23rd, at a rate as high as 3 feet per hour.  The crest was at 30.3 feet around 2145E on the 23rd.  This was the 3rd highest crest on record for Clay, and the highest since 1918. Further down the river at Queen Shoals, just above Clendenin, the water level rose 27 feet in the vertical, at a rate as high as 2.5 feet per hour. The crest was 33.37 feet around 0445E on the 24th.  This was the highest on record for Queen Shoals. The previous record was 32 feet back in 1888. The high water mark was 5 feet high on buildings in downtown Clendenin.  A similar high water mark was noted across the Elk River in the large grocery store.  ||In comparison to the Elk and Gauley drainage, the river flooding on the Greenbrier River in Pocahontas County was minor.  The headwaters of the Greenbrier River were north of the heavy rain axis.  The crest in Marlinton was 12 feet during the late evening of the 23rd, with flood stage at 10 feet.  Further down the river, the level at Buckeye crested just below the 12 foot flood stage.  ||The flash floods and river floods caused fatalities in Kanawha and Jackson Counties.  Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, or Pocahontas Counties. Severe damage and destruction of homes, businesses, and schools occurred. Roads were damaged. In the worst cases, sections of road bed were washed away.  Public bridges and small private bridges were damaged or destroyed. Large debris piles collected against bridges. Countless vehicles were flooded.  Electricity and water were lost for days in the hardest hit flood areas.         ||The American Red Cross had over 800 workers helping at its peak.  They distributed over 7,500 cleanup kits and over 100,000 meals and snacks.  Many church based organizations and ordinary individual citizens volunteered their time and services to help in the flood recovery.  Nationally known celebrities and sport figures, with ties to West Virginia, also helped to raise awareness and increase donations for flood recovery.||The state transportation secretary estimated 8 million dollars in damage to roads in Clay County, 8 million dollars in Nicholas, over 13 million in Kanawha County.||Several schools were severely damaged by flood waters. This included in Clay County, White Elementary and the county bus garage. In Kanawha County, Herbert Hoover High School, Clendenin Elementary, Elk Valley Christian School, plus Bridge Elementary Schools were severely damaged.  Water from the Elk River crested about 7 feet deep in the first flood at Herbert Hoover High School. In Nicholas County. Richwood High and Middle School was severely damaged.  Moderate flood damage occurred to Clay High School and Elkview Middle School.  Minor flood damage occurred at Middle Birch Elementary School in Braxton County.  Minor flood damage also was seen in Ansted Elementary in Fayette County and Glade Elementary in Webster County.||A state of emergency was declared by Governor Tomblin.  At its peak deployment, around 650 members of the West Virginia Army National Guard and West Virginia Air National Guard were activated.  Major tasks assigned to the guard troops included delivering supplies to residents with no road access, and removal of flood debris.  Private contractors were also used for debris removal. In just Kanawha County, 15,000 tons of flood debris were collected.       ||A federal disaster was quickly declared by President Obama.  At least 8 counties were eligible from the events of June 23rd and 24th within the forecast area of the National Weather Service in Charleston. They included Jackson, Roane, Kanawha, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties.  See FEMA disaster number 4273-DR for more information.  Over 4900 individuals applied for federal assistance from those 8 counties, totaling over 20 million dollars.  Public assistance for debris removal, emergency protective services, roads, bridges, and schools, was over 50 million dollar in those same 8 counties.","River flooding occurred on the Meadow and lower Gauley Rivers along the northern border of Fayette County.  Russellville was flooded and Route 41 damaged.  One resident of Russellville said, and when it got too so much, I grabbed the kids and I left.  You couldn't stay. You'd have drowned.||A preliminary damage assessment was done in Fayette County.  In both the flash flooding and river flooding, about 15 homes were destroyed. Another dozen or so homes were damaged.",CSV

Satellite imagery showed a deep tap of tropical moisture into West Virginia and a strengthening upper level jet providing additional lift. A warm front was located just north of the area and became a focus for convection in the early morning hours of the 23rd. During the late morning to early afternoon convection continued to train across the same general area of southeast WV and far western VA with hourly rainfall rates of 1.50 to 2 for several hours.||Radar and rain gauge measurements showed as much as 4 to 8 inches (perhaps higher locally) fell in a band across central Alleghany County. The bulk of the rain fell in less than 12 hours between 600 AM and 600 PM EDT. The Governor of Virginia declared a state of emergency in the City of Covington and Alleghany County.||The phenomenal runoff from creeks, streams and overland flow produced an extreme hydrologic response on larger rivers including the Jackson River. The river gage at Covington (CVGV2) rose over 10 feet in 5 hours to reach Flood Stage (17 feet) for the first time since September 2004 (during the remains of Hurricane Jeanne).  A River Flood Warning (FLW) was issued at 609 PM as the river was near 15 feet and the crest was only 4.5 hours later at 22.33 feet just below the Major Flood Stage of 23 feet. This was highest stage reached at the Covington gage since the November 1985 flood (23.31 feet) and 2nd highest since the construction of Gathright Dam in 1979. Gathright Dam was built to reduce flooding on the Jackson River but so much rain fell in the watershed below the dam that flooding still occurred at Covington. Numerous homes and several businesses in Covington suffered severe flood damage from the Jackson River.  At the same time Dunlap Creek (DLPV2), which drains 162 mi2 of western Alleghany County and empties into the Jackson River in Covington was also rising at an extreme rate, climbing from a stage of around 3 feet (445 cfs) at 200 PM to a record stage of 16.49 feet (30,300 cfs) in a little over 6 hours.  The previous record at this gage was 15.65 feet (27,400 cfs) set in June 1972 with the remains of Hurricane Agnes. Hydrological peak stage records at this gage date back to 1929. According to USGS flood frequency reports this flood was likely in excess of a 200-year (0.005 AEP) event on Dunlap Creek. There was extensive flooding along Dunlap Creek with roads and homes flooded and some requiring evacuations. Flooding continued downstream and a few hours later a River Flood Warning was issued for the upper James River including the forecast points at Lick Run (LIRV2) and Buchanan (BNNV2) both of which easily reached flood stage. At Lick Run the crest of 22.84 feet was the 10th highest on record (continuous records since 1925) and the highest since January 1996 (25.03 feet).  Per USGS data the 48,000 cfs discharge at Lick Run was roughly a 10-year (.10 AEP) flood event. At Buchanan the 42,900 cfs was merely somewhere between a 2- to 5-year event (0.5 to 0.2 AEP).",Flash flooding was first reported in Alleghany County at 215 PM EDT (115 PM EST) as Indian Draft Road (Route 600) was closed. Numerous additional reports and social media reports continued to be received through the afternoon. Numerous small streams flooded including Wilson Creek which overflowed Route 629 (Douthat Park Road). The most serious flooding was along Dunlap Creek with runs through the southwestern portions of the county joining the Jackson River just north of Covington. More than 25 homes were badly damaged in the county most of them along Dunlap Creek which set a new flood of record (see Episode for details). Water was reported over Route 60 from Dunlap Creek in several areas. Two water rescues by boat were performed and several landslides were reported including one that was reported to have closed Pitzer Ridge Road (Route 657) east of Route 18.

A key ingredient to this disaster was the fact that less than 2 days earlier, 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain had fallen over parts of Clay, Webster, and Nicholas Counties. As a result, a higher percentage of the rain on the 23rd went directly into runoff than usual.     ||Here are the maximum measured storm rain totals.  Laurel Ridge in Clay County measured 7.21 inches of rain.  A volunteer observer in Runa of Nichalas County had 7.2 inches. Along the county line with Clay and Kanawha Counties, Queen Shoals measured 7.12 inches of rain.  Birch River had 5.81 inches, Summersville 5.65 inches, Craigsville 5.63 inches, Richwood 5.53 inches, Sutton 5.47 inches, Hacker Valley 5.06 inches, Sissonville 4.02 inches, Snowshoe 3.97 inches, and Spencer 3.74 inches. An automatic gauge west of Summersville Lake near Keslers Cross Lanes measured 6.16 inches. At one point during the afternoon, this gauge measured 1.1 inches of rain in just 15 minutes.  A gauge near the headwaters of Beach Fork in western Nicholas County measured 5.5 inches of rain.   An unofficial rain gauge at a coal company near Werth of Nicholas County measured a 6.6 inch rain total.        |  |Severe flash flooding occurred on the creeks and streams during the later rounds of showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon. This was quickly followed by river flooding on the Greenbrier, Elk, and Gauley Rivers. This included the smaller tributaries such as the Williams River and the Meadow River in the Gauley River basin, plus the Birch River in the Elk River basin.  Fatalities occurred in Kanawha and Jackson Counties. Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties. ||Record stages were set on the upper Gauley River.  Dyer on the Williams River rose 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd and crested at 20.78 feet around 1915E.  The previous record level at Dyer was 18.45 feet back on July 4th in 1932.  The flooding in Richwood was as much from the runoff off the steep mountainsides flowing rapidly down through the streets, as it was from the overflowing Cherry River.  Laurel Creek, a tributary of the Cherry River, near Fenwick crested at 12.34 feet around 2000E.   On the main stem of the Gauley River, Craigsville crested at 29.04 feet after rising 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd.   At one point between 1400 and 1500E the river rose 3 feet in 1 hour.  The crest time was 2200E on the 23rd at Craigsville.  The previous record was 25.94 feet back in November of 2003.  The crest at Camden on Gauley was above the level of the instrument shelf table in the river stage well house.  Of course, this caused the instruments to fail.  Before failure, the river was rising nearly 3 feet per hour.  In the wake of the flood, the well defined high water mark was used to calculated the crest.  After a vertical rise of around 24 feet, the crest at Camden on Gauley was 29.75 feet near 2145E on the 23rd. The previous record was 27.38 feet, back on July 4th in 1932.  In the town of Camden on Gauley, the high water mark was 7 feet high on buildings.  While holding the discharge down, the Corps of Engineers saw Summersville Lake rise 41 feet in the vertical during this flood.||Below Summersville Dam a huge discharge was noted from the Meadow River into the lower Gauley River.  The surge of water coming from western Greenbrier County caused the lower Meadow River at Nallen to rise 19.5 feet in the vertical and crest at 24.50 feet at 2015E on the 23rd. The previous record crest at Nallen was 16.94 feet back in December of 1969.  Further down the Gauley River, despite Summersville Dam holding back much of the outflow from the upper Gauley basin, the gauge at Belva still rose 22 feet in the vertical in less than 18 hours.  Belva crested at 27.04 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This crest was the 2nd highest on record. The 5th of July crest in 1932, well prior to the dam, was 28.6 feet at Belva.  One resident near Belva said of the river flood, ???It just kind of looked like the ocean, and it just swarmed in. And it just didn???t go back.???||In the upper Elk River basin, the gauge below Webster Springs at Clifton Ford crested at 17.36 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This was not a record crest, but the highest since the start of the 20th century.  Herold on the Birch River, after rising 15 feet in the vertical, crested at 18.03 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  The previous record was 13.7 feet in December 2013.      ||On the lower Elk River, below the Corps of Engineers flood control dam at Sutton, the water level at Clay rose 26 feet in the vertical during the 23rd, at a rate as high as 3 feet per hour.  The crest was at 30.3 feet around 2145E on the 23rd.  This was the 3rd highest crest on record for Clay, and the highest since 1918. Further down the river at Queen Shoals, just above Clendenin, the water level rose 27 feet in the vertical, at a rate as high as 2.5 feet per hour. The crest was 33.37 feet around 0445E on the 24th.  This was the highest on record for Queen Shoals. The previous record was 32 feet back in 1888. The high water mark was 5 feet high on buildings in downtown Clendenin.  A similar high water mark was noted across the Elk River in the large grocery store.  ||In comparison to the Elk and Gauley drainage, the river flooding on the Greenbrier River in Pocahontas County was minor.  The headwaters of the Greenbrier River were north of the heavy rain axis.  The crest in Marlinton was 12 feet during the late evening of the 23rd, with flood stage at 10 feet.  Further down the river, the level at Buckeye crested just below the 12 foot flood stage.  ||The flash floods and river floods caused fatalities in Kanawha and Jackson Counties.  Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, or Pocahontas Counties. Severe damage and destruction of homes, businesses, and schools occurred. Roads were damaged. In the worst cases, sections of road bed were washed away.  Public bridges and small private bridges were damaged or destroyed. Large debris piles collected against bridges. Countless vehicles were flooded.  Electricity and water were lost for days in the hardest hit flood areas.         ||The American Red Cross had over 800 workers helping at its peak.  They distributed over 7,500 cleanup kits and over 100,000 meals and snacks.  Many church based organizations and ordinary individual citizens volunteered their time and services to help in the flood recovery.  Nationally known celebrities and sport figures, with ties to West Virginia, also helped to raise awareness and increase donations for flood recovery.||The state transportation secretary estimated 8 million dollars in damage to roads in Clay County, 8 million dollars in Nicholas, over 13 million in Kanawha County.||Several schools were severely damaged by flood waters. This included in Clay County, White Elementary and the county bus garage. In Kanawha County, Herbert Hoover High School, Clendenin Elementary, Elk Valley Christian School, plus Bridge Elementary Schools were severely damaged.  Water from the Elk River crested about 7 feet deep in the first flood at Herbert Hoover High School. In Nicholas County. Richwood High and Middle School was severely damaged.  Moderate flood damage occurred to Clay High School and Elkview Middle School.  Minor flood damage occurred at Middle Birch Elementary School in Braxton County.  Minor flood damage also was seen in Ansted Elementary in Fayette County and Glade Elementary in Webster County.||A state of emergency was declared by Governor Tomblin.  At its peak deployment, around 650 members of the West Virginia Army National Guard and West Virginia Air National Guard were activated.  Major tasks assigned to the guard troops included delivering supplies to residents with no road access, and removal of flood debris.  Private contractors were also used for debris removal. In just Kanawha County, 15,000 tons of flood debris were collected.       ||A federal disaster was quickly declared by President Obama.  At least 8 counties were eligible from the events of June 23rd and 24th within the forecast area of the National Weather Service in Charleston. They included Jackson, Roane, Kanawha, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties.  See FEMA disaster number 4273-DR for more information.  Over 4900 individuals applied for federal assistance from those 8 counties, totaling over 20 million dollars.  Public assistance for debris removal, emergency protective services, roads, bridges, and schools, was over 50 million dollar in those same 8 counties.","Severe flash flooding occurred in the northeastern portion of the county.  Streams such as Jordan Creek, Doctors Creek, Thorofare Run, Little Sandy Creek, Wills Creek, and the lower reaches of Big Sandy Creek caused much destruction. ||Little Sandy Creek inundated one large culvert over the only road access to a shopping plaza. The road collapsed.  Many shoppers were stranded.  About 200 people slept in their vehicles overnight, before walking out on the 24th.   ||A 62 year old male drowned along Jordan Creek.

Flash flooding on small streams turned into river flooding. A historic and record setting flood occurred along portions of the Elk and Gauley Rivers in central West Virginia.  Less significant flooding occurred on the perimeter of the hardest hit area.||The initial convective complex developed during the evening hours of the 22nd near Chicago.  The complex reached southeast Ohio just after 0000E on the 23d, while a surface warm front was returning northeast into West Virginia.  A few renegade storms even formed ahead of the complex along the warm front.  ||The first round of convection entered West Virginia around 0100E on the 23rd. It crossed West Virginia during the predawn hours with downpours and gusty winds. Within this initial round of convection, a brief tornado was confirmed in Jackson County. Also, a microburst was surveyed just south of Birch River in Nicholas County. ||The first complex exited the eastern counties of the state a few hours after dawn.  Yet, the undisturbed southwest low level flow, of moisture rich air, allowed new convection to form in its wake.  These new showers and storms formed in the mid Ohio Valley from southern Ohio eastward toward the Huntington and Charleston vicinity. These thunderstorms moved back east, across central West Virginia during the late morning and midday time frame.  In the muggy air, additional storms formed during the afternoon and early evening hours.  The rains finally diminished after 1900E on the 23rd.  The total duration of these multiple rounds of convective showers and storms encompassed no more than 18 hours.||A 2 to 4 inch rain maximum occurred with the initial convective complex.  This initial rain maximum ran from near Parkersburg on up the Little Kanawha River Valley to near Glenville and through Upshur Counties.  Other heavier bands were in Lewis and Harrison Counties. For example, by 0900E, Pullman in Ritchie County and Spurgeon in Gilmer County both measured 3.76 inches. Harrisville in Ritchie County measured 3.48 inches of rain. Willow Island on the Ohio River measure 3.38 inches. French Creek had 3.4 inches of rain.  The cooperative observer at Clarksburg measured 3.30 inches, Stonewall Jackson Lake in Lewis County had 3.05 inches and Rock Cave measured 2.8 inches of rain.  In terms of rain rates, the Clarksburg airport in Bridgeport had .5 inches of rain in just 8 minutes, with 1.36 inches of rain in about 40 minutes.  Minor flash flooding occurred with this initial convective band during the predawn and dawn time frame.  Less rains fell further south.  For example, Big Chimney in Kanawha County had 1.76 inches by 0900E. ||The new convection that formed during the morning of the 23rd, saw its heavier rain fall south of the initial band.  The rain axis went from Jackson County on southeast into Clay and Nicholas Counties.  By 1200E, Poe North in Nicholas County had 4.52 inches of rain, Laurel Ridge in Clay county had a 3.72 inches total, and Muddlety in Nicholas County measured a 3.31 inch rain total.||After the third and fourth rounds of convection during the afternoon and evening, a 4 to 7.5 inch rainfall maximum occurred in less than 18 hours. The axis of this maximum rain went from Jackson County on southeast through Roane, northern Kanawha, Clay, Nicholas, Webster, into southern Pocahontas.

Hermine weakened slightly to Tropical Storm strength and crossed through Eastern North Carolina during the late evening on September 2nd, and exited off the North Carolina coast near Duck during the morning of September 3rd. The lowest pressure of 994.3 mb was measured on 03/0629 UTC at a mesonet site located at Fort Macon in Carteret county. Highest official winds were measured at the Duck tide gauge DUKN7 where sustained speeds of 71 mph with gusts to 84 mph occurred between 1447 and 1454 UTC on the 3rd. These strong winds led to sporadic power outages across eastern North Carolina. Official Storm surge flooding of 2 to 4 feet above ground level occurred along much of the coast. The highest surge of 3 to 4 feet was observed on the sound side of the Outer Banks on the morning of the 3rd as strong north winds developed on the backside of Hermine as it passed offshore.  Preliminary damage from storm surge was estimated at 5.5 million dollars with the vast majority of this occurring across Outer Banks Dare County. Rain-bands associated with Hermine produced two EF1 tornadoes and one EF0 tornado that led to around 30 thousand in property damage.  Bands of heavy rain associated with Hermine produced rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches over most of the region, with the highest amounts near the coast. This heavy rain produced widespread poor drainage flooding with a few reports of flash flooding.",Tropical Storm Hermine produced significant impacts across Outer Banks Dare county. Strong north winds developed during the morning and early afternoon of September 3rd as Hermine moved northeast of the region. Winds of 60 to 70 mph were common over Hatteras Island with a peak gust of 84 mph recorded at the Duck Pier at 947 am est on September 3rd. These strong winds led to structural damage to several homes and businesses. These strong winds also pushed water from the Pamlico sound onshore leading to moderate to major sound-side storm surge of 2 to 4 feet above ground level. This storm surge flooded many homes and businesses with significant damage to some. The highest surge values of 3 to 4 feet were observed between Buxton and Hatteras Village.  On the ocean side moderate beach erosion and ocean over wash was observed damaging roads and a few homes. Very heavy rain led to some flash flooding over the Hatteras Village area and an EF0 tornado also damaged a couple cabins in the Hatteras Village community. Overall damage was estimated at 5.4 million dollars over Outer Banks Dare county with most of this caused by storm surge flooding.,CSV

Showers and thunderstorms repeatedly tracked to the northwest along a track parallel to the Wind River Range. Rainfall totals of 2.50??? to 4.50??? were common within a 50-mile-long, 15-mile-wide swath along and northeast of the foothills of the Wind River Range. The heavy rainfall produced widespread flooding and caused the Little Wind River to reach its third highest all-time crest at 10.19 feet. It was also the first time the river crested over action stage of 7 feet in the month of May. Flooding along the river subsided on Tuesday, May 10.","Widespread heavy rain of 2.50 to 4.50 fell in a broad swath across Fremont County during a 48-hour period from Friday evening, May 6, through Sunday evening, May 8. There was a peak rainfall amount of 6.88??? at a rain gauge about 6 miles west of Fort Washakie on the Little Wind River. The heavy rain fell over the lower elevations of the Wind River Basin and in the lower foothills of the Wind River Range.||The heaviest rainfall occurred between 1900MST Friday, May 6, and 1700MST Saturday, May 7. The rain gauge at Lander Hunt Field reported 3.82??? in this 22-hour period, with 1.12??? falling between 0800MST and 1100MST Saturday. The heavy rainfall contributed to significant rises along the Little Wind River and its tributaries, particularly the Little Popo Agie River through Lyons Valley. The rapid river rises produced substantial flooding from Lyons Valley, to Hudson, to Arapahoe.||Overland flow was a significant contributor to the rapidly rising rivers. Recent rains had left soils relatively wet, so as rainfall piled up on Saturday morning water began to flow across fields, overwhelm ditches, and fill ravines. These waters made their way to the larger rivers and quickly filled them. By early Saturday afternoon, there were reports of water covering low-lying areas of roads north and northwest of Lander. The rain was so heavy that water seeped through the walls at the hospital in Lander prompting the evacuation of patients. Some basement flooding was reported in residential areas of Lander. By mid-afternoon Saturday, reports were received of flood waters on the Little Popo Agie River surrounding homes in Lyons Valley. Several rural roads were either covered with water or damaged by the flood waters in the valley. The flood waters on this tributary combined with the already high water on the Popo Agie River to cause water levels to surge in Hudson late Saturday evening and early Sunday morning. The subsequent flooding damaged or destroyed several mobile homes along the river on the west side of Hudson. Sunday afternoon saw the retreat of water levels on these rivers with a subsequent decrease in flood-related problems.||Multiple tributaries and overland flow to small creeks, streams, and ditches quickly filled the Little Wind River near Arapahoe downstream to around Riverton. The river topped flood stage of 8 feet at 0605MST Sunday, May 8, and climbed about 1 foot every three to four hours during the morning and early afternoon. The  river crested at 10.19 feet between 1545MST and 1600MST Sunday as residents along the river scrambled to fill sandbags and move property to a safer location. Flood waters on the Little Wind River retreated slowly on Monday, May 9, before falling below flood stage at 0120MST on Tuesday, May 10. The river fell below action stage by the end of Tuesday.",CSV

The weather pattern, and associated boundaries were nearly stationary through early Thursday morning, September 22nd. The atmosphere was very moist, which was evident in the soundings as near record high Precipitable Water (PWAT) values were noted.  ||Although the most significant part of this weather event was flooding, some large hail was observed the evening of September 20th, and during the afternoon and evening of Wednesday, September 21st. ||The evening of Tuesday, September 20th, an area of thunderstorms formed along and north of the warm front in southern Minnesota. Heavy rain fell in south central Minnesota, especially near Waseca. A Flash Flood Warning was issued for portions of southern Minnesota but no major issues were reported. Ultimately, 2 to 3 inches of rain fell in a rather short period of time near Janesville and Waseca late Tuesday night. This rainfall event, although localized, created very wet antecedent conditions before the main heavy rainfall event developed the evening of Wednesday, September 21st.||The evening and overnight of September 21st-22nd saw much more and widespread heavy rainfall across southern Minnesota. Two areas that were hit the hardest occurred across Hennepin and Anoka counties, in the Twin Cities metro area, and around Mankato, Waseca and Owatonna. ||The worst and most significant flash flood event occurred between Greenfield, Corcoran in Hennepin County, eastward to Spring Lake Park, Fridley, Lexington and Lino Lakes in Anoka County. The first heavy rainfall event occurred between 5 PM and 8 PM CST. This event produced between 3 and 6 inches of rainfall in less than 3 hours, with some areas receiving 3 to 4 inches of rain in less than 90 minutes based on local observations. The second event produced an additional 2 to 4 inches after 9 PM CST in the same areas which prompted a small region to have a Flash Flood Emergency issued. Upwards of 7, to nearly 10 inches of rain fell before midnight. Due to this extreme event, there were hundreds of abandoned cars with water reaching the car windows in northwest metro suburbs during the height of the storm. Interstate 94 in the north metro was closed for a period that night. Five private residents had 3-4 feet of water in their basements, and two homes had water completed filled to the top in Maple Grove. In addition to the homes, there were 15 county roads closed at one point around Maple Grove and Brooklyn Park based on reports from the Hennepin County Emergency Management. A small part of Highway 169 near the border of Maple Grove and Brooklyn Park was closed for 4 days due to the runoff from earlier torrential rainfall.  ||The other flash flood event occurred near Mankato (northeast Blue Earth County) eastward through Waseca and Steele Counties. Thunderstorms that developed Wednesday evening were much more widespread, and trained over the same areas along and north of the front. Rainfall amounts ranged from 4 to 6 inches from Mankato, to Albert Lea, Kenyon and Faribault.

This brought the two-day total at that location to 10.16 inches, including the 2.52 inches of rain that fell with the first wave on September 20-21. This is the highest two-day total ever recorded in Waseca.||Due to the ground that was already saturated from earlier torrential rainfall the day before, the flooding situation became extreme, with ongoing areal flooding lasting for  the next several days as the runoff continued. ||There were many reports of basements flooded, closed roads and washouts, and standing water in Waseca and other locations as well.

Loon Lake in Waseca rose over its banks and flooded nearby streets in town. The rising waters of Fountain Lake in Albert Lea encroached into town during the day on September 23, detouring Highway 65 (Main Street) near the lake.||According to the emergency manager at least 75 percent of the homes in the Waseca area were damaged by flooding. A line nearly 200 yards long of trucks and cars filled with wet carpets, furniture and waterlogged TVs and appliances was lined up at the City of Waseca debris dump site. ||There was major flooding on rivers and creeks across portions of southern Minnesota that lasted for several days beyond the event.

Other rivers, and streams that rose significant or crested above flood stage were the Straight, Cannon, Cobb and Le Sueur. ||During the height of the flood event, I-694, I-90, and Highway 169 in Minnesota were closed for a time due to high water. Dozens of county roads were also closed near Waseca, Minnesota in south central MN. Many stalled vehicles, flooded basements and a few localized evacuations took place around southern Minnesota.||Reports from the Minnesota Department of Transportation had numerous state roads closed through Thursday, September 22nd as runoff continued. Some of the major roads that were affected by the flood waters in south central Minnesota included; Highways 13, 14, 30, 71, 83, 22, 28, and 15.  ||Several of the main roads didn't reopen until Friday morning, September 23rd.

Flash flooding on small streams turned into river flooding. A historic and record setting flood occurred along portions of the Elk and Gauley Rivers in central West Virginia.  Less significant flooding occurred on the perimeter of the hardest hit area.||The initial convective complex developed during the evening hours of the 22nd near Chicago.  The complex reached southeast Ohio just after 0000E on the 23d, while a surface warm front was returning northeast into West Virginia.  A few renegade storms even formed ahead of the complex along the warm front.  ||The first round of convection entered West Virginia around 0100E on the 23rd. It crossed West Virginia during the predawn hours with downpours and gusty winds. Within this initial round of convection, a brief tornado was confirmed in Jackson County. Also, a microburst was surveyed just south of Birch River in Nicholas County. ||The first complex exited the eastern counties of the state a few hours after dawn.  Yet, the undisturbed southwest low level flow, of moisture rich air, allowed new convection to form in its wake.  These new showers and storms formed in the mid Ohio Valley from southern Ohio eastward toward the Huntington and Charleston vicinity. These thunderstorms moved back east, across central West Virginia during the late morning and midday time frame.  In the muggy air, additional storms formed during the afternoon and early evening hours.  The rains finally diminished after 1900E on the 23rd.  The total duration of these multiple rounds of convective showers and storms encompassed no more than 18 hours.||A 2 to 4 inch rain maximum occurred with the initial convective complex.  This initial rain maximum ran from near Parkersburg on up the Little Kanawha River Valley to near Glenville and through Upshur Counties.  Other heavier bands were in Lewis and Harrison Counties. For example, by 0900E, Pullman in Ritchie County and Spurgeon in Gilmer County both measured 3.76 inches. Harrisville in Ritchie County measured 3.48 inches of rain. Willow Island on the Ohio River measure 3.38 inches. French Creek had 3.4 inches of rain.  The cooperative observer at Clarksburg measured 3.30 inches, Stonewall Jackson Lake in Lewis County had 3.05 inches and Rock Cave measured 2.8 inches of rain.  In terms of rain rates, the Clarksburg airport in Bridgeport had .5 inches of rain in just 8 minutes, with 1.36 inches of rain in about 40 minutes.  Minor flash flooding occurred with this initial convective band during the predawn and dawn time frame.  Less rains fell further south.  For example, Big Chimney in Kanawha County had 1.76 inches by 0900E. ||The new convection that formed during the morning of the 23rd, saw its heavier rain fall south of the initial band.  The rain axis went from Jackson County on southeast into Clay and Nicholas Counties.  By 1200E, Poe North in Nicholas County had 4.52 inches of rain, Laurel Ridge in Clay county had a 3.72 inches total, and Muddlety in Nicholas County measured a 3.31 inch rain total.||After the third and fourth rounds of convection during the afternoon and evening, a 4 to 7.5 inch rainfall maximum occurred in less than 18 hours. The axis of this maximum rain went from Jackson County on southeast through Roane, northern Kanawha, Clay, Nicholas, Webster, into southern Pocahontas. The rain maximum continued into central Greenbrier County, which is handled by the Blacksburg office of the National Weather Service.  This elongated heavy rain axis was oriented on a compass heading from around 305 degrees to 125 degrees. The width of the heavy rain area went from around 30 miles near the Ohio River to about 50 miles in the central mountain counties.  A key ingredient to this disaster was the fact that less than 2 days earlier, 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain had fallen over parts of Clay, Webster, and Nicholas Counties. As a result, a higher percentage of the rain on the 23rd went directly into runoff than usual.     ||Here are the maximum measured storm rain totals.  Laurel Ridge in Clay County measured 7.21 inches of rain.  A volunteer observer in Runa of Nichalas County had 7.2 inches. Along the county line with Clay and Kanawha Counties, Queen Shoals measured 7.12 inches of rain.  Birch River had 5.81 inches, Summersville 5.65 inches, Craigsville 5.63 inches, Richwood 5.53 inches, Sutton 5.47 inches, Hacker Valley 5.06 inches, Sissonville 4.02 inches, Snowshoe 3.97 inches, and Spencer 3.74 inches. An automatic gauge west of Summersville Lake near Keslers Cross Lanes measured 6.16 inches. At one point during the afternoon, this gauge measured 1.1 inches of rain in just 15 minutes.  A gauge near the headwaters of Beach Fork in western Nicholas County measured 5.5 inches of rain.   An unofficial rain gauge at a coal company near Werth of Nicholas County measured a 6.6 inch rain total.        |  |Severe flash flooding occurred on the creeks and streams during the later rounds of showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon. This was quickly followed by river flooding on the Greenbrier, Elk, and Gauley Rivers. This included the smaller tributaries such as the Williams River and the Meadow River in the Gauley River basin, plus the Birch River in the Elk River basin.  Fatalities occurred in Kanawha and Jackson Counties. Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties. ||Record stages were set on the upper Gauley River.  Dyer on the Williams River rose 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd and crested at 20.78 feet around 1915E.  The previous record level at Dyer was 18.45 feet back on July 4th in 1932.  The flooding in Richwood was as much from the runoff off the steep mountainsides flowing rapidly down through the streets, as it was from the overflowing Cherry River.  Laurel Creek, a tributary of the Cherry River, near Fenwick crested at 12.34 feet around 2000E.   On the main stem of the Gauley River, Craigsville crested at 29.04 feet after rising 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd.   At one point between 1400 and 1500E the river rose 3 feet in 1 hour.  The crest time was 2200E on the 23rd at Craigsville.  The previous record was 25.94 feet back in November of 2003.  The crest at Camden on Gauley was above the level of the instrument shelf table in the river stage well house.  Of course, this caused the instruments to fail.  Before failure, the river was rising nearly 3 feet per hour.  In the wake of the flood, the well defined high water mark was used to calculated the crest.  After a vertical rise of around 24 feet, the crest at Camden on Gauley was 29.75 feet near 2145E on the 23rd. The previous record was 27.38 feet, back on July 4th in 1932.  In the town of Camden on Gauley, the high water mark was 7 feet high on buildings.  While holding the discharge down, the Corps of Engineers saw Summersville Lake rise 41 feet in the vertical during this flood.||Below Summersville Dam a huge discharge was noted from the Meadow River into the lower Gauley River.  The surge of water coming from western Greenbrier County caused the lower Meadow River at Nallen to rise 19.5 feet in the vertical and crest at 24.50 feet at 2015E on the 23rd. The previous record crest at Nallen was 16.94 feet back in December of 1969.  Further down the Gauley River, despite Summersville Dam holding back much of the outflow from the upper Gauley basin, the gauge at Belva still rose 22 feet in the vertical in less than 18 hours.  Belva crested at 27.04 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This crest was the 2nd highest on record. The 5th of July crest in 1932, well prior to the dam, was 28.6 feet at Belva.  One resident near Belva said of the river flood, ???It just kind of looked like the ocean, and it just swarmed in. And it just didn???t go back.???||In the upper Elk River basin, the gauge below Webster Springs at Clifton Ford crested at 17.36 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This was not a record crest, but the highest since the start of the 20th century.  Herold on the Birch River, after rising 15 feet in the vertical, crested at 18.03 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  The previous record was 13.7 feet in December 2013.      ||On the lower Elk River, below the Corps of Engineers flood control dam at Sutton, the water level at Clay rose 26 feet in the vertical during the 23rd, at a rate as high as 3 feet per hour.  The crest was at 30.3 feet around 2145E on the 23rd.  This was the 3rd highest crest on record for Clay, and the highest since 1918. Further down the river at Queen Shoals, just above Clendenin, the water level rose 27 feet in the vertical, at a rate as high as 2.5 feet per hour. The crest was 33.37 feet around 0445E on the 24th.  This was the highest on record for Queen Shoals. The previous record was 32 feet back in 1888. The high water mark was 5 feet high on buildings in downtown Clendenin.  A similar high water mark was noted across the Elk River in the large grocery store.  ||In comparison to the Elk and Gauley drainage, the river flooding on the Greenbrier River in Pocahontas County was minor.  The headwaters of the Greenbrier River were north of the heavy rain axis.  The crest in Marlinton was 12 feet during the late evening of the 23rd, with flood stage at 10 feet.  Further down the river, the level at Buckeye crested just below the 12 foot flood stage.  ||The flash floods and river floods caused fatalities in Kanawha and Jackson Counties.  Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, or Pocahontas Counties. Severe damage and destruction of homes, businesses, and schools occurred. Roads were damaged. In the worst cases, sections of road bed were washed away.  Public bridges and small private bridges were damaged or destroyed. Large debris piles collected against bridges. Countless vehicles were flooded.  Electricity and water were lost for days in the hardest hit flood areas.         ||The American Red Cross had over 800 workers helping at its peak.  They distributed over 7,500 cleanup kits and over 100,000 meals and snacks.  Many church based organizations and ordinary individual citizens volunteered their time and services to help in the flood recovery.  Nationally known celebrities and sport figures, with ties to West Virginia, also helped to raise awareness and increase donations for flood recovery.||The state transportation secretary estimated 8 million dollars in damage to roads in Clay County, 8 million dollars in Nicholas, over 13 million in Kanawha County.||Several schools were severely damaged by flood waters. This included in Clay County, White Elementary and the county bus garage. In Kanawha County, Herbert Hoover High School, Clendenin Elementary, Elk Valley Christian School, plus Bridge Elementary Schools were severely damaged.  Water from the Elk River crested about 7 feet deep in the first flood at Herbert Hoover High School. In Nicholas County. Richwood High and Middle School was severely damaged.  Moderate flood damage occurred to Clay High School and Elkview Middle School.  Minor flood damage occurred at Middle Birch Elementary School in Braxton County.  Minor flood damage also was seen in Ansted Elementary in Fayette County and Glade Elementary in Webster County.||A state of emergency was declared by Governor Tomblin.  At its peak deployment, around 650 members of the West Virginia Army National Guard and West Virginia Air National Guard were activated.  Major tasks assigned to the guard troops included delivering supplies to residents with no road access, and removal of flood debris.  Private contractors were also used for debris removal. In just Kanawha County, 15,000 tons of flood debris were collected.       ||A federal disaster was quickly declared by President Obama.  At least 8 counties were eligible from the events of June 23rd and 24th within the forecast area of the National Weather Service in Charleston. They included Jackson, Roane, Kanawha, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties.  See FEMA disaster number 4273-DR for more information.  Over 4900 individuals applied for federal assistance from those 8 counties, totaling over 20 million dollars.  Public assistance for debris removal, emergency protective services, roads, bridges, and schools, was over 50 million dollar in those same 8 counties.","Widespread flash flooding occurred on small headwater rivers, like the Cherry, plus the small streams and runs throughout the county.  Due to the saturated mountain slopes, water cascaded down mountainsides where no stream existed, as was the case in Richwood. Many water rescues took place and much of the town of Richwood was evacuated. The evacuation included a nursing home with 97 patients.  One resident of Richwood said, just seems like there was a cloudburst right back on this mountain. It just all came at one time. It was just like a big river coming down through here.  In the wake of this flooding, previously abandoned homes on the mountainside were demolished.  Severe flooding also occurred in the community of Birch River.||Peters Creek in Lockwood crested near 17 feet around 1845E after rising over 11 feet in the vertical. ||The flash flooding transitioned into river flooding along the Gauley, upstream of Summersville Dam, and along the Meadow River and the border with Fayette County.",CSV

Flash flooding on small streams turned into river flooding. A historic and record setting flood occurred along portions of the Elk and Gauley Rivers in central West Virginia.  Less significant flooding occurred on the perimeter of the hardest hit area.||The initial convective complex developed during the evening hours of the 22nd near Chicago.  The complex reached southeast Ohio just after 0000E on the 23d, while a surface warm front was returning northeast into West Virginia.  A few renegade storms even formed ahead of the complex along the warm front.  ||The first round of convection entered West Virginia around 0100E on the 23rd. It crossed West Virginia during the predawn hours with downpours and gusty winds. Within this initial round of convection, a brief tornado was confirmed in Jackson County. Also, a microburst was surveyed just south of Birch River in Nicholas County. ||The first complex exited the eastern counties of the state a few hours after dawn.  Yet, the undisturbed southwest low level flow, of moisture rich air, allowed new convection to form in its wake.  These new showers and storms formed in the mid Ohio Valley from southern Ohio eastward toward the Huntington and Charleston vicinity. These thunderstorms moved back east, across central West Virginia during the late morning and midday time frame.  In the muggy air, additional storms formed during the afternoon and early evening hours.  The rains finally diminished after 1900E on the 23rd.  The total duration of these multiple rounds of convective showers and storms encompassed no more than 18 hours.||A 2 to 4 inch rain maximum occurred with the initial convective complex.  This initial rain maximum ran from near Parkersburg on up the Little Kanawha River Valley to near Glenville and through Upshur Counties.  Other heavier bands were in Lewis and Harrison Counties. For example, by 0900E, Pullman in Ritchie County and Spurgeon in Gilmer County both measured 3.76 inches. Harrisville in Ritchie County measured 3.48 inches of rain. Willow Island on the Ohio River measure 3.38 inches. French Creek had 3.4 inches of rain.  The cooperative observer at Clarksburg measured 3.30 inches, Stonewall Jackson Lake in Lewis County had 3.05 inches and Rock Cave measured 2.8 inches of rain.  In terms of rain rates, the Clarksburg airport in Bridgeport had .5 inches of rain in just 8 minutes, with 1.36 inches of rain in about 40 minutes.  Minor flash flooding occurred with this initial convective band during the predawn and dawn time frame.  Less rains fell further south.  For example, Big Chimney in Kanawha County had 1.76 inches by 0900E. ||The new convection that formed during the morning of the 23rd, saw its heavier rain fall south of the initial band.  The rain axis went from Jackson County on southeast into Clay and Nicholas Counties.  By 1200E, Poe North in Nicholas County had 4.52 inches of rain, Laurel Ridge in Clay county had a 3.72 inches total, and Muddlety in Nicholas County measured a 3.31 inch rain total.||After the third and fourth rounds of convection during the afternoon and evening, a 4 to 7.5 inch rainfall maximum occurred in less than 18 hours. The axis of this maximum rain went from Jackson County on southeast through Roane, northern Kanawha, Clay, Nicholas, Webster, into southern Pocahontas. The rain maximum continued into central Greenbrier County, which is handled by the Blacksburg office of the National Weather Service.  This elongated heavy rain axis was oriented on a compass heading from around 305 degrees to 125 degrees. The width of the heavy rain area went from around 30 miles near the Ohio River to about 50 miles in the central mountain counties.  A key ingredient to this disaster was the fact that less than 2 days earlier, 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain had fallen over parts of Clay, Webster, and Nicholas Counties. As a result, a higher percentage of the rain on the 23rd went directly into runoff than usual.     ||Here are the maximum measured storm rain totals.  Laurel Ridge in Clay County measured 7.21 inches of rain.  A volunteer observer in Runa of Nichalas County had 7.2 inches. Along the county line with Clay and Kanawha Counties, Queen Shoals measured 7.12 inches of rain.  Birch River had 5.81 inches, Summersville 5.65 inches, Craigsville 5.63 inches, Richwood 5.53 inches, Sutton 5.47 inches, Hacker Valley 5.06 inches, Sissonville 4.02 inches, Snowshoe 3.97 inches, and Spencer 3.74 inches. An automatic gauge west of Summersville Lake near Keslers Cross Lanes measured 6.16 inches. At one point during the afternoon, this gauge measured 1.1 inches of rain in just 15 minutes.  A gauge near the headwaters of Beach Fork in western Nicholas County measured 5.5 inches of rain.   An unofficial rain gauge at a coal company near Werth of Nicholas County measured a 6.6 inch rain total.        |  |Severe flash flooding occurred on the creeks and streams during the later rounds of showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon. This was quickly followed by river flooding on the Greenbrier, Elk, and Gauley Rivers. This included the smaller tributaries such as the Williams River and the Meadow River in the Gauley River basin, plus the Birch River in the Elk River basin.

This rain fell on wet to in some cases saturated soil due to much above normal rainfall in September. The result was historic flooding; widespread flash flooding, and an extended period of major to record river flooding. Matthew's flooding rains, surge and wind brought loss of life, displaced tens of thousands of people, and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in structural damage as homes and businesses were devastated or totally destroyed. Major infrastructure will have to be repaired or rebuilt.","Hurricane Matthew moved up the eastern seaboard, bringing very heavy rain and strong winds. Rainfall amounts were less in Georgetown county than most of the region, averaging over five inches.  There were isolated areas in the north portion of the county near eight inches.

Crop specialists from the University of Minnesota Extension service indicated that corn and soybean yields had some damage in central Minnesota, especially around Willmar. Corn had broken or bruised stalks, along with dislodged roots and leaf loss from the wind and hail. ||The northern storm went from Alexandria, southeast to Paynesville, Buffalo and the northwest part of the Twin Cities metro area. Eventually this storm moved across most of the Twin Cities metro area, with the most damage from northern Hennepin, through Ramsey and southern Washington.  ||The second storm followed a similar path from west central Minnesota, southeast to just north of the Minnesota River Valley, then across the southern part of the Twin Cities metro area. The two storms merged across southern Minnesota from near Faribault, northeast to Red Wing, and to near Eau Claire Wisconsin. This storm rapidly moved southeast and became a large bow echo that raced across southern Wisconsin, and northern Illinois by Wednesday morning.  ||The northern storm produced several measured wind gusts in excess of 70 mph across Wright, Hennepin, Ramsey and Washington counties. The worst damage which a storm survey estimated winds near 80 mph, produced a six mile long damage path of downed transmission lines near St. Michaels and Rogers. As the storms moved into the western metro area, there were numerous reports of downed trees and power lines, with measured severe wind gusts at both Crystal and Flying Cloud airports. The downtown St. Paul airport also measured a severe wind gust as the storms moved into Ramsey and into Washington county. The Maple Grove hospital had structural damage to their building. Pavers from an upper roof blew off and penetrated a roof below. This caused rain to seep into patient rooms and to the 1st floor imaging and PCC. ||There were some issues related to flooded roads in the Minneapolis, St. Paul metropolitan area, but most of the flooded roads were concentrated in poor drainage where rain water had no place to go.  ||The second and southern storm initially produced several large hail reports, up to 2 inches in diameter from Cosmos to Hutchinson. This storm began to bow out in the southwest suburbs of the Twin Cities near Jordon, Prior Lake and Burnsville and moved southeast. This storm produced two tornadoes, one east of  Faribault, and another west of Goodhue.||During the height of the storm, Xcel Energy reported more than 138,000 customers without power.","A storm survey revealed that damaging straight line winds caused sporadic tree damage and a six mile long string of transmission lines to be destroyed.

This storm was unusually warm for the region for late December and produced record breaking heavy rain along with flooding in some cases. Significant icing occurred across areas at or just below the freezing point, which resulted in widespread tree and power pole and line damage to the area. Some downed branches and trees fell onto homes across the region. This storm also brought high winds along with snow and blizzard conditions to the region. This significant storm resulted in massive power outages, stranded motorists and closed roads. ||Ice accumulations were significant across central and northeastern South Dakota with over an inch accumulation for some locations. High winds during this event increased the amount of power pole, line, and tree damage. Those who did not see freezing rain accumulations had to deal with ice as well. The ponding of the heavy rain froze overnight once much colder air moved in. Roads and walkways became treacherous ice rinks and remained as such for many days. There were numerous injuries from slips on the ice, as well as several vehicular accidents and flight cancellations. Livestock was also affected, though most made it through the storm. Dairy operations dealt with frozen drinking water tanks.||Precipitation amounts were very impressive for late December, as the system had near record levels of atmospheric moisture to work with. Rain or freezing rain was the predominant precipitation type for those roughly east of the Missouri River on the 25th. Some of the heaviest rainfall amounts include: 0.82 inches at Sisseton and Summit, 0.99 inches at Eureka, 1.05 inches at Miller, 1.11 inches at Leola, 1.14 inches at Victor, 1.28 inches at Aberdeen, 1.34 inches at Orient, 1.44 inches at Bath, 1.48 inches at Westport and 1.73 inches southwest of Stratford. From this rainfall, ice accumulation amounts ranged from a quarter inch to nearly an inch and a half in places. The highest measured ice accumulation was 1.37 inches about 2 miles east of Summit.||Daily precipitation records were set on the 25th for Mobridge with 1.52 inches, Pierre with 0.92 of an inch, Aberdeen with 1.28 inches, and Sisseton with 0.7 of an inch. Aberdeen and Mobridge also broke records for their wettest December day on record, while Pierre recording their 2nd wettest December day on record. Finally, Mobridge also broke their record for the wettest winter day (December through February) with Aberdeen recording their 3rd wettest winter day on record. In Aberdeen, the heavy rainfall combined with melting snow and ice to produce flooding across several streets, driveways, and garages. No doubt a remarkable amount of moisture for a late December winter storm system. Rare thunderstorms, more indicative of spring than winter, were also widely reported on both the rain and snow side of this system across the area on the 25th.||High winds gusting to over 70 mph impacted the entire region on the 25th and 26th. The combination of snow and ice and high winds snapped or otherwise damaged hundreds of power poles, downed several thousand miles of power lines, damaged several hundred transmission structures and brought many substations down. Many roads were blocked by power lines.  Overall, more than one hundred lineman worked to bring the power back. ||Twenty-one counties encompassing 30 communities and 3 Indian reservations were impacted. Entire communities, thousands of homes and businesses, and ultimately over 12,000 people went without power. For some, power was not restored for 10 days despite tireless efforts. All power was restored by January 4th, 2017. Water and sewer systems shut down for several days for some communities and emergency shelters were necessary. Deuel, Day, Marshall, Roberts and Grant counties were the hardest hit. County and city governments were overwhelmed by ice accumulations and blizzard conditions and struggled with maintaining accessibility even for emergency traffic. Road conditions deteriorated to the point where it took up to several hours for emergency officials to respond to 911 calls. The storm proved to be fatal when a Walworth County man fell, hit his head and succumbed to the elements on Christmas Day.  ||National Weather Service operations were impacted as well. The surface observing station in Aberdeen and Mobridge were adversely affected or went completely down during the storm. Additionally, the upper air shelter, which houses weather balloons, was frozen shut and thus inaccessible for the morning launch on the 26th.||Due to widespread significant impacts, the Governor of South Dakota declared a State of Emergency on the 26th which helped facilitate the movement of out-of-state crews to aid with power restoration. There was also a Presidential Disaster Declaration for damage to public property. The total estimated damage was near 8 million dollars for central and northeast South Dakota.",,CSV

Timing-wise, this was a fairly early show as convection first entered far southwestern local counties such as Furnas/Gosper between 10:30-11:30 AM, swept through central areas including the Tri Cities between 12 PM and 1:30 PM and eventually exited far northeastern counties such as Polk/Nance between 2-3 PM. While most locations experienced sub-severe winds up to around 50 MPH, brief heavy rain and perhaps small hail with the passage of these storms, there were several transient small-scale bowing segments and circulations embedded within the line, resulting in pockets of damaging winds and three confirmed, short-track tornadoes. These tornadoes (two rated EF-0, one EF-1) all occurred between 11:45 AM-12:30 PM and lasted only a few minutes. The first tornado, near Funk, destroyed several large power poles. The second tornado produced minor damage at a farm southeast of Minden, and the third destroyed an outbuilding at Blue Sky Estates northwest of Gibbon. A few of the most significant damage reports not directly attributed to tornadic circulations included: construction trailers blown over and a barn destroyed on the west side of Kearney; and machine shed and tree damage southeast of Bruning. ||Even though the day had already featured highly-unusual and locally-damaging Christmas weather, for many places the worst was yet to come in the form of the widespread evening damaging wind event, which largely unfolded under clear skies due to strong subsidence on the backside of an intense low pressure system. At nearly any given affected location, there were at least a few peak gusts of 60-75 MPH from the west-southwest, along with two to perhaps three hours of sustained speeds 30-50 MPH. Timing-wise, high winds rapidly overspread most of South Central Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast, with severe-criteria gusts first measured in counties such as Furnas/Harlan shortly after 5 PM, central locations such as Grand Island/Hastings between 6-7 PM and far northern counties such as Valley by 8 PM. Finally, between 9:30 and 10:30 PM, winds eased below High Wind Warning criteria for the night. Based on dozens of reports from automated sensors, only the southeastern fringe of South Central Nebraska (generally southeast of a Red Cloud-Geneva line) was spared widespread damaging winds. Meanwhile, across the rest of the area, just a sampling of peak measured wind gusts included: 76 MPH at Aurora airport, 75 MPH at Grand Island airport and near Oxford, 73 MPH near Franklin, 72 MPH in Osceola and 71 MPH at the NWS office in Hastings. Needless to say, these evening winds resulted in fairly widespread, mainly minor damage to trees, power lines and some structures, and also flipped over numerous irrigation pivots. Forecast-wise, while gusty winds were anticipated to move in behind the departing low, the ferocity of this event exceeded expectations.||Closing with an examination of the meteorological setup, it certainly was more reminiscent of March or April in South Central Nebraska than late-December. In the mid-upper levels, a powerful, negatively-tilted vorticity maximum deepened over the course of the day as it emerged from the Central Rockies, reaching north central Nebraska by early evening. Just to the southeast of the mid-level low center, a formidable upper jet streak of 120+ knots migrated overhead. At the surface, it was a classic setup for low-topped, severe convection as a deep low pressure system intensified to around 986 millibars in far northeast CO by noon, allowing a warm front to surge northward across South Central Nebraska. Despite considerable cloud cover, temperatures rising into the 50s F and dewpoints climbing into the mid-40s to low-50s F allowed mixed-layer CAPE to reach a few hundred J/kg. Combined with strong deep-layer wind shear of generally 60-80 knots and exceptional low-level shear of 50-60 knots, even this relatively meager instability proved sufficient for damaging winds and brief tornadoes. By early evening, the intense surface low pressure center reached north central Nebraska, placing the local area behind an occluded Pacific cold front and within a zone of deep atmospheric subsidence. In tandem with other factors such as steadily-rising pressures and increased vertical mixing, this allowed very strong west-southwest winds within a few thousand feet of the surface to mix downward, driving the evening damaging wind event.","Wind gusts estimated to up to 80 MPH caused damage in the Kearney area.

Timing-wise, this was a fairly early show as convection first entered far southwestern local counties such as Furnas/Gosper between 10:30-11:30 AM, swept through central areas including the Tri Cities between 12 PM and 1:30 PM and eventually exited far northeastern counties such as Polk/Nance between 2-3 PM. While most locations experienced sub-severe winds up to around 50 MPH, brief heavy rain and perhaps small hail with the passage of these storms, there were several transient small-scale bowing segments and circulations embedded within the line, resulting in pockets of damaging winds and three confirmed, short-track tornadoes. These tornadoes (two rated EF-0, one EF-1) all occurred between 11:45 AM-12:30 PM and lasted only a few minutes. The first tornado, near Funk, destroyed several large power poles. The second tornado produced minor damage at a farm southeast of Minden, and the third destroyed an outbuilding at Blue Sky Estates northwest of Gibbon. A few of the most significant damage reports not directly attributed to tornadic circulations included: construction trailers blown over and a barn destroyed on the west side of Kearney; and machine shed and tree damage southeast of Bruning. ||Even though the day had already featured highly-unusual and locally-damaging Christmas weather, for many places the worst was yet to come in the form of the widespread evening damaging wind event, which largely unfolded under clear skies due to strong subsidence on the backside of an intense low pressure system. At nearly any given affected location, there were at least a few peak gusts of 60-75 MPH from the west-southwest, along with two to perhaps three hours of sustained speeds 30-50 MPH. Timing-wise, high winds rapidly overspread most of South Central Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast, with severe-criteria gusts first measured in counties such as Furnas/Harlan shortly after 5 PM, central locations such as Grand Island/Hastings between 6-7 PM and far northern counties such as Valley by 8 PM. Finally, between 9:30 and 10:30 PM, winds eased below High Wind Warning criteria for the night. Based on dozens of reports from automated sensors, only the southeastern fringe of South Central Nebraska (generally southeast of a Red Cloud-Geneva line) was spared widespread damaging winds. Meanwhile, across the rest of the area, just a sampling of peak measured wind gusts included: 76 MPH at Aurora airport, 75 MPH at Grand Island airport and near Oxford, 73 MPH near Franklin, 72 MPH in Osceola and 71 MPH at the NWS office in Hastings. Needless to say, these evening winds resulted in fairly widespread, mainly minor damage to trees, power lines and some structures, and also flipped over numerous irrigation pivots. Forecast-wise, while gusty winds were anticipated to move in behind the departing low, the ferocity of this event exceeded expectations.||Closing with an examination of the meteorological setup, it certainly was more reminiscent of March or April in South Central Nebraska than late-December. In the mid-upper levels, a powerful, negatively-tilted vorticity maximum deepened over the course of the day as it emerged from the Central Rockies, reaching north central Nebraska by early evening. Just to the southeast of the mid-level low center, a formidable upper jet streak of 120+ knots migrated overhead. At the surface, it was a classic setup for low-topped, severe convection as a deep low pressure system intensified to around 986 millibars in far northeast CO by noon, allowing a warm front to surge northward across South Central Nebraska. Despite considerable cloud cover, temperatures rising into the 50s F and dewpoints climbing into the mid-40s to low-50s F allowed mixed-layer CAPE to reach a few hundred J/kg. Combined with strong deep-layer wind shear of generally 60-80 knots and exceptional low-level shear of 50-60 knots, even this relatively meager instability proved sufficient for damaging winds and brief tornadoes. By early evening, the intense surface low pressure center reached north central Nebraska, placing the local area behind an occluded Pacific cold front and within a zone of deep atmospheric subsidence. In tandem with other factors such as steadily-rising pressures and increased vertical mixing, this allowed very strong west-southwest winds within a few thousand feet of the surface to mix downward, driving the evening damaging wind event.","The highest wind gust of 73 mph was measured at 6:19 p.m. by a mesonet site 2 miles north of Norman. Other wind gusts during this period included 67 mph four miles north-northwest of Hildreth, 60 mph two miles east of Axtell and 57 mph six miles northwest of Minden.

Shortly after noon, these already strong winds ratcheted up into destructive territory as the cold front drew closer.  Numerous wind gusts between 60 and 75 mph were measured for just over one hour near Plains, with a peak wind gust of 79 mph measured near Denver City accompanying the front's passage.  These winds created several thick plumes of blowing dust which led to dust storm conditions and zero visibility at times.||Beside the dust storm and temperatures plummeting into the teens and 20s behind the Arctic front, the worst impacts were dealt to property in the form of widespread minor structural damage to roofs, buildings, downed trees and snapped utility lines. A few structures in Denver City lost windows and even had roofs completely removed from the fierce winds. Multiple fast moving wildfires were also reported in Yoakum County from fallen utility lines, but no damage was reported with the fires.||To underscore the magnitude of the cold air, very light sleet was reported in Plains just 55 minutes after a temperature of 70??

At the surface, it was a classic setup for low-topped, severe convection as a deep low pressure system intensified to around 986 millibars in far northeast CO by noon, allowing a warm front to surge northward across South Central Nebraska.

By early evening, the intense surface low pressure center reached north central Nebraska, placing the local area behind an occluded Pacific cold front and within a zone of deep atmospheric subsidence. In tandem with other factors such as steadily-rising pressures and increased vertical mixing, this allowed very strong west-southwest winds within a few thousand feet of the surface to mix downward, driving the evening damaging wind event.","Based on observations from neighboring counties such as Hall and Hamilton, a significant high wind event impacted Merrick County for over two hours, likely featuring peak gusts of generally 60-75 MPH and sustained speeds 40-50 MPH.",CSV

Combined with strong deep-layer wind shear of generally 60-80 knots and exceptional low-level shear of 50-60 knots, even this relatively meager instability proved sufficient for damaging winds and brief tornadoes. By early evening, the intense surface low pressure center reached north central Nebraska, placing the local area behind an occluded Pacific cold front and within a zone of deep atmospheric subsidence. In tandem with other factors such as steadily-rising pressures and increased vertical mixing, this allowed very strong west-southwest winds within a few thousand feet of the surface to mix downward, driving the evening damaging wind event.",The highest wind gust of 76 mph was measured at 7:15 p.m. by the AWOS at the Aurora airport.

Damage estimates from the Killdeer area were around $20 million. Upscale growth then occurred with storms forming into a quasi-linear convective system that pushed through central North Dakota and then the James River Valley. Strong thunderstorm winds accompanied the line of storms. Additional elevated storms then formed later in the night over southwest and south central North Dakota as a low level jet increased and an upper level trough approached, with storms continuing overnight.","A slow moving supercell resulted in an extended period of very large hail and damaging wind gusts in and around the city of Killdeer. Hail up to 3.25 inches in diameter completely covered the ground in many locations. The hail combined with wind gusts of 75 mph to cause extreme damage to buildings, trees, and vehicles in the city. At the Killdeer nursing home windows were broken out and four rooms were damaged to the point where they were not habitable. Two residents sustained minor injuries. The first was injured (direct injury) when they were struck by broken flying glass. The other person was injured (direct injury) as they were evacuating their living area due to broken windows and fell on a wet floor as rain and hail were pouring in.
