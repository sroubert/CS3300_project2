These severe thunderstorms exited the region during the mid evening hours into the Ark-La-Miss region where additional tornadoes and instances of severe thunderstorm damage was reported.","An EF-2 tornado with maximum winds estimated near 130 mph touched down near Highway 49 just west of the Smithland community, snapping and uprooting numerous trees and downing power lines as it tracked northeast across Highway 43 just north of its intersection of Highway 49. As it crossed Highway 43, the tornado moved several vehicles, completely debarked 3-4 trees about 25-30 feet above the ground, and threw a party barge about 200 yards into a grove of trees. Trees were also downed on a few homes and a travel trailer was flipped over. The tornado continued northeast crossing County Road 3300, where it removed a roof of a home and shifted the home slightly off of its pad. A 75 year old woman inside this home took shelter inside a bathtub before the tornado ripped the tub out of the home and deposited it into some nearby woods. The woman suffered only some cuts and bruises but was able to walk away. The tornado continued northeast crossing County Road 3306 two different times, before entering far southeast Cass County on County Road 4455.

Ahead of this system, unseasonably warm, humid, and unstable air spread northward across much of the Ark-La-Tex from the Gulf of Mexico in advance of this system and associated Pacific cold front. A surface low pressure system also developed along the advancing cold front, with low level winds backing more southeast ahead of the upper level low. Coupled with strong wind shear and instability, scattered severe supercell thunderstorms rapidly developed during the mid and late afternoon hours across portions of extreme Eastern Texas, Southern Arkansas, and Northern Louisiana. The considerable wind shear contributed to rotating updrafts, such that twelve tornadoes touched down across the aforementioned areas. Instances of large hail was also reported with these supercells, given the very cold temperatures aloft. These severe thunderstorms exited the region during the mid evening hours into the Ark-La-Miss region where additional tornadoes and instances of severe thunderstorm damage was reported.","This is a continuation of the Bossier Parish tornado. This tornado had weakened to EF-1 as it entered Northwest Webster Parish, but still uprooted numerous trees and power lines along its track and it tore through the Muddy Bottoms ATV Park.

An extremely cold airmass shifted slowly south and west into eastern New Mexico on the 5th while a moist, slow-moving upper level wave shifted north and east from Arizona through the 6th. The combination of bitterly cold air at the surface and abundant mid and upper level moisture resulted in a major winter storm across New Mexico. Temperatures in the single digits with widespread snowfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches created severe travel conditions across the eastern plains. The Sangre de Cristo Mountains were pummeled with 1 to 2 feet of snowfall. Bitterly cold air seeped into the Rio Grande Valley from the eastern plains on the morning of the 6th while a band of snowfall pushed across the area. Temperatures in the middle teens with around one inch of snow created treacherous travel conditions across the Albuquerque metro area. Nearly 100 motor vehicle accidents shut down many roads across the city and closed schools. Shelters were opened in many areas and the New Mexico EOC was activated for several days until impacts improved. The coldest air since 2011 filtered into the state behind this storm. Wind chill values across the eastern plains fell to between 20 and 30 degrees below zero.",Snowfall across the Raton Ridge ranged from 12 to 20 inches. The combination of temperatures in the single digits and strong gusty winds created treacherous travel conditions across the area. Travel over Raton Pass was nearly impossible with over 20 spin outs and numerous wrecks reported along Interstate 25.

Ahead of this system, unseasonably warm, humid, and unstable air spread northward across much of the Ark-La-Tex from the Gulf of Mexico in advance of this system and associated Pacific cold front. A surface low pressure system also developed along the advancing cold front, with low level winds backing more southeast ahead of the upper level low. Coupled with strong wind shear and instability, scattered severe supercell thunderstorms rapidly developed during the mid and late afternoon hours across portions of extreme Eastern Texas, Southern Arkansas, and Northern Louisiana. The considerable wind shear contributed to rotating updrafts, such that twelve tornadoes touched down across the aforementioned areas. Instances of large hail was also reported with these supercells, given the very cold temperatures aloft. These severe thunderstorms exited the region during the mid evening hours into the Ark-La-Miss region where additional tornadoes and instances of severe thunderstorm damage was reported.","An EF-1 tornado with maximum estimated winds between 90 and 100 mph touched down along Highway 165 between Georgetown and Pollock where it snapped several large trees. The tornado continued northeast across a heavily wooded area before it tracked across Camp Hardtner on Camp Hardtner Road, snapping and uprooting numerous trees. A large pine tree fell onto one of the meeting buildings at the camp, and shingles were removed off of a nearby home and adjacent meeting buildings. The tornado lifted shortly after exiting Camp Hardtner."

The tornado tracked east along Sandefur Road causing significant damage to trees and power lines with minor roof damage to homes south of Sandefur Road along Griswold Way. The tornado turned more northeasterly damaging a sports complex and a business along Cohen Walker Road. The tornado crossed Highway 96 near Peach Blossom Road and continued northeast through neighborhoods west of Bonanza Drive causing minor roof damage and downing trees and power lines as it continued across Faegan Mill Road and Moody Drive. At this point the tornado intensified to its strongest level. Brick fences were blown down and numerous trees were snapped or uprooted along Sandy Run Road and Echo Lane. The worst damage occurred near the WalMart and adjacent neighborhoods around Windmill Court. Two large HVAC units were tossed around 50 yards from the top of the WalMart. The auto bay garage doors on the back of the store were blown in and the roof lifted. Rafters on the opposite end of the store were twisted.

With a very tight pressure gradient, winds increased ahead of the storm reaching in excess of 50 mph that led to some damage reports. A few periods of heavy rainfall occurred. Excessive rainfall close to 2 inches was focused in sections of Northern and Eastern New Jersey. The storm also brought a strong onshore flow which resulted in  minor to moderate tidal flooding for the high tide cycles on the 23rd and 24th. Minor tidal flooding occurred with the tidal cycles on the 23rd and the morning cycle on the 24th with a few reports of moderate tidal flooding on the 24th. Minor tidal flooding on the afternoon of the 23rd closed a lane on the George Redding bridge. Considerable beach erosion occurred during the event as well across all of New Jersey coastal counties, including a 70 percent loss of the dunes near the Matoloking and Harvey Ceders beaches.  It was also cold enough for a mixture of snow, sleet and freezing rain in the highest elevations in the northwest portion of the state. With road temperatures in the low 30's, some slick conditions were encountered with school delays as a result. Snow and sleet accumulations ranged from a couple tenths of an inch near Randolph Twp to almost three inches at Highland lakes. ice accumulation of three tenths was measured in Vernon.

Excessive rainfall close to 2 inches was focused in sections of Northern and Eastern New Jersey. The storm also brought a strong onshore flow which resulted in  minor to moderate tidal flooding for the high tide cycles on the 23rd and 24th. Minor tidal flooding occurred with the tidal cycles on the 23rd and the morning cycle on the 24th with a few reports of moderate tidal flooding on the 24th. Minor tidal flooding on the afternoon of the 23rd closed a lane on the George Redding bridge. Considerable beach erosion occurred during the event as well across all of New Jersey coastal counties, including a 70 percent loss of the dunes near the Matoloking and Harvey Ceders beaches.  It was also cold enough for a mixture of snow, sleet and freezing rain in the highest elevations in the northwest portion of the state.

Multi band structured lake effect snow began east of Lake Erie and Ontario through the afternoon hours of Wednesday, January 4th.  Embedded within these bands were several stronger bands, which brought very narrow stripes of heavy snow east of the lakes, before the winds began to veer, sending snows southward overnight across the Ski Country and the Southern Tier east of Lake Erie, and across the southern Tug Hill east of Lake Ontario. Backing winds began to lift a plume of lake effect snow from over the Southern Tier and Ski Country early Thursday morning towards the far southern towns of Buffalo by late morning Thursday. Snowfall rates began to increase to 3 inches per hour along and just inland from the Lake Erie shoreline early Thursday afternoon. By mid to late afternoon on Thursday the band of snow was oriented along the long axis of Lake Erie, where added low level convergence and residence time over the lake strengthened the band of snow to 4 to 5 inches per hour over an area from Lake View to Orchard Park on the south side of the band, and Blasdell and West Seneca on the north side of the band. This heavy snowfall, combined with the late afternoon rush hour of people leaving work and schools, brought traffic to a standstill over the Buffalo Southtowns. The snow accumulated so quickly that plows were unable to keep up with the clearing of the snow, which led to people abandoning their cars on the Thruway and local roads, evening commutes extending to 6 hours or more, and school busses returning back to school, unable to deliver children to their homes. This snow band reached its northern extent from the City of Buffalo and near the southern end of the airport before starting to slide southward through the late evening and overnight hours. Snowfall rates were not as strong later in the evening, which allowed the plows to begin the dig-out from an event that dropped over two-feet of fresh snow over portions of the Buffalo Southtowns in only 6 to 8 hours. Snowfall decreased rapidly farther inland, with just several inches falling over far northeastern Erie County, and into Genesee and Livingston Counties. East of Lake Ontario Thursday, the snow band remained anchored over northern and central Jefferson and northern Lewis Counties. The low level convergent wind was so strong that the upstream shortwave nudge the band only slightly northward, but still added additional low level moisture that brought snowfall rates of 4 inches per hour to Watertown, Fort Drum and other central Jefferson County communities.  Later Thursday night, and early Friday morning the lake effect snow band dropped back south towards the Tug Hill region, bringing an additional half to one foot of snow through the night. The snow band transitioned into an anticyclonic structure towards Friday morning, where heavy lake effect snow in northern Oswego County quickly brought the event totals up towards 2 feet of snow.  Lake effect snows continued, somewhat disorganized through Friday Night. On Saturday morning these lake bands formed mesolows on the east side of both lakes. As for Lake Erie, Saturday morning the band was hugging the shoreline from about Ripley to Angola. This made for hazardous travel conditions along the I-90 Thruway in this corridor, with all commercial traffic banned for much of the day. By Saturday afternoon and evening, the band pushed inland across northern Chautauqua, northern Cattaraugus and southern Erie counties. Saturday night the band reoriented across the western Southern Tier on the westerly flow, producing a multi-banded structure with upslope enhancement over the Chautauqua Ridge and Boston Hills. On Lake Ontario Saturday, a mesolow developed on the east end of the lake, with a tea kettle band in place across the center of the lake. Initially, snow on the south side of the mesolow was impacting the shoreline of northern Cayuga and Oswego County, near the city of Oswego. By late morning Saturday, the mesolow moved farther offshore bringing a break in the snowfall east of Lake Ontario until the afternoon. The center of the mesolow made landfall across central Oswego County, with the heaviest snow concentrated on the south side of the low, as is typically the case. During the course of the evening, the lingering enhanced area of convergence on the south side of the mesolow focused a band of heavy snow that slowly moved from northern Cayuga County into central Oswego County. Snowfall rates were observed at about 4 inches per hour in the heaviest part of the snow band. Overnight, a secondary mesolow tracked into northern Jefferson County bringing a burst of snow across Jefferson county and central Lewis county, although accumulations from this were fairly minor as the snow lost intensity away from the lake. Snowfall amounted to about a foot and half overnight in that most persistent band, with Oswego, Mexico and north of Fulton topping the list of reports. On Sunday, lake effect bands reoriented on a northwesterly flow. Lake effect snow began to diminish in intensity.  |Off Lake Erie, specific snowfall reports included:  46 inches at Perrysburg,  45 inches at Colden, 42 inches at Forestville, 33 inches at Springville, 28 inches at Blasdell, 27 inches at Glenwood, 26 inches at West Seneca and Boston, 24 inches at East Concord, 23 inches at Portland, West Seneca and Hamburg, 21 inches at Dunkirk and Orchard Park, 20 inches at Fredonia, 19 inches at Angola and Warsaw, 18 inches at Little Valley, East Aurora and Marilla, 17 inches at Ripley, 16 inches at Dayton, Silver Creek and New Albion, 14 inches at Attica and Wyoming,13 inches at Lackawanna, 12 inches at Kennedy and Warsaw, 11 inches at Franklinville, and 10 inches at Randolph.

Snowfall rates began to increase to 3 inches per hour along and just inland from the Lake Erie shoreline early Thursday afternoon. By mid to late afternoon on Thursday the band of snow was oriented along the long axis of Lake Erie, where added low level convergence and residence time over the lake strengthened the band of snow to 4 to 5 inches per hour over an area from Lake View to Orchard Park on the south side of the band, and Blasdell and West Seneca on the north side of the band. This heavy snowfall, combined with the late afternoon rush hour of people leaving work and schools, brought traffic to a standstill over the Buffalo Southtowns. The snow accumulated so quickly that plows were unable to keep up with the clearing of the snow, which led to people abandoning their cars on the Thruway and local roads, evening commutes extending to 6 hours or more, and school busses returning back to school, unable to deliver children to their homes. This snow band reached its northern extent from the City of Buffalo and near the southern end of the airport before starting to slide southward through the late evening and overnight hours. Snowfall rates were not as strong later in the evening, which allowed the plows to begin the dig-out from an event that dropped over two-feet of fresh snow over portions of the Buffalo Southtowns in only 6 to 8 hours. Snowfall decreased rapidly farther inland, with just several inches falling over far northeastern Erie County, and into Genesee and Livingston Counties. East of Lake Ontario Thursday, the snow band remained anchored over northern and central Jefferson and northern Lewis Counties. The low level convergent wind was so strong that the upstream shortwave nudge the band only slightly northward, but still added additional low level moisture that brought snowfall rates of 4 inches per hour to Watertown, Fort Drum and other central Jefferson County communities.  Later Thursday night, and early Friday morning the lake effect snow band dropped back south towards the Tug Hill region, bringing an additional half to one foot of snow through the night. The snow band transitioned into an anticyclonic structure towards Friday morning, where heavy lake effect snow in northern Oswego County quickly brought the event totals up towards 2 feet of snow.  Lake effect snows continued, somewhat disorganized through Friday Night. On Saturday morning these lake bands formed mesolows on the east side of both lakes. As for Lake Erie, Saturday morning the band was hugging the shoreline from about Ripley to Angola. This made for hazardous travel conditions along the I-90 Thruway in this corridor, with all commercial traffic banned for much of the day. By Saturday afternoon and evening, the band pushed inland across northern Chautauqua, northern Cattaraugus and southern Erie counties. Saturday night the band reoriented across the western Southern Tier on the westerly flow, producing a multi-banded structure with upslope enhancement over the Chautauqua Ridge and Boston Hills. On Lake Ontario Saturday, a mesolow developed on the east end of the lake, with a tea kettle band in place across the center of the lake. Initially, snow on the south side of the mesolow was impacting the shoreline of northern Cayuga and Oswego County, near the city of Oswego. By late morning Saturday, the mesolow moved farther offshore bringing a break in the snowfall east of Lake Ontario until the afternoon. The center of the mesolow made landfall across central Oswego County, with the heaviest snow concentrated on the south side of the low, as is typically the case. During the course of the evening, the lingering enhanced area of convergence on the south side of the mesolow focused a band of heavy snow that slowly moved from northern Cayuga County into central Oswego County. Snowfall rates were observed at about 4 inches per hour in the heaviest part of the snow band. Overnight, a secondary mesolow tracked into northern Jefferson County bringing a burst of snow across Jefferson county and central Lewis county, although accumulations from this were fairly minor as the snow lost intensity away from the lake. Snowfall amounted to about a foot and half overnight in that most persistent band, with Oswego, Mexico and north of Fulton topping the list of reports. On Sunday, lake effect bands reoriented on a northwesterly flow.

Saturday night the band reoriented across the western Southern Tier on the westerly flow, producing a multi-banded structure with upslope enhancement over the Chautauqua Ridge and Boston Hills. On Lake Ontario Saturday, a mesolow developed on the east end of the lake, with a tea kettle band in place across the center of the lake. Initially, snow on the south side of the mesolow was impacting the shoreline of northern Cayuga and Oswego County, near the city of Oswego. By late morning Saturday, the mesolow moved farther offshore bringing a break in the snowfall east of Lake Ontario until the afternoon. The center of the mesolow made landfall across central Oswego County, with the heaviest snow concentrated on the south side of the low, as is typically the case. During the course of the evening, the lingering enhanced area of convergence on the south side of the mesolow focused a band of heavy snow that slowly moved from northern Cayuga County into central Oswego County. Snowfall rates were observed at about 4 inches per hour in the heaviest part of the snow band. Overnight, a secondary mesolow tracked into northern Jefferson County bringing a burst of snow across Jefferson county and central Lewis county, although accumulations from this were fairly minor as the snow lost intensity away from the lake. Snowfall amounted to about a foot and half overnight in that most persistent band, with Oswego, Mexico and north of Fulton topping the list of reports. On Sunday, lake effect bands reoriented on a northwesterly flow. Lake effect snow began to diminish in intensity.  |Off Lake Erie, specific snowfall reports included:  46 inches at Perrysburg,  45 inches at Colden, 42 inches at Forestville, 33 inches at Springville, 28 inches at Blasdell, 27 inches at Glenwood, 26 inches at West Seneca and Boston, 24 inches at East Concord, 23 inches at Portland, West Seneca and Hamburg, 21 inches at Dunkirk and Orchard Park, 20 inches at Fredonia, 19 inches at Angola and Warsaw, 18 inches at Little Valley, East Aurora and Marilla, 17 inches at Ripley, 16 inches at Dayton, Silver Creek and New Albion, 14 inches at Attica and Wyoming,13 inches at Lackawanna, 12 inches at Kennedy and Warsaw, 11 inches at Franklinville, and 10 inches at Randolph.

Multi band structured lake effect snow began east of Lake Erie and Ontario through the afternoon hours of Wednesday, January 4th.  Embedded within these bands were several stronger bands, which brought very narrow stripes of heavy snow east of the lakes, before the winds began to veer, sending snows southward overnight across the Ski Country and the Southern Tier east of Lake Erie, and across the southern Tug Hill east of Lake Ontario. Backing winds began to lift a plume of lake effect snow from over the Southern Tier and Ski Country early Thursday morning towards the far southern towns of Buffalo by late morning Thursday. Snowfall rates began to increase to 3 inches per hour along and just inland from the Lake Erie shoreline early Thursday afternoon. By mid to late afternoon on Thursday the band of snow was oriented along the long axis of Lake Erie, where added low level convergence and residence time over the lake strengthened the band of snow to 4 to 5 inches per hour over an area from Lake View to Orchard Park on the south side of the band, and Blasdell and West Seneca on the north side of the band. This heavy snowfall, combined with the late afternoon rush hour of people leaving work and schools, brought traffic to a standstill over the Buffalo Southtowns. The snow accumulated so quickly that plows were unable to keep up with the clearing of the snow, which led to people abandoning their cars on the Thruway and local roads, evening commutes extending to 6 hours or more, and school busses returning back to school, unable to deliver children to their homes. This snow band reached its northern extent from the City of Buffalo and near the southern end of the airport before starting to slide southward through the late evening and overnight hours. Snowfall rates were not as strong later in the evening, which allowed the plows to begin the dig-out from an event that dropped over two-feet of fresh snow over portions of the Buffalo Southtowns in only 6 to 8 hours. Snowfall decreased rapidly farther inland, with just several inches falling over far northeastern Erie County, and into Genesee and Livingston Counties. East of Lake Ontario Thursday, the snow band remained anchored over northern and central Jefferson and northern Lewis Counties. The low level convergent wind was so strong that the upstream shortwave nudge the band only slightly northward, but still added additional low level moisture that brought snowfall rates of 4 inches per hour to Watertown, Fort Drum and other central Jefferson County communities.  Later Thursday night, and early Friday morning the lake effect snow band dropped back south towards the Tug Hill region, bringing an additional half to one foot of snow through the night. The snow band transitioned into an anticyclonic structure towards Friday morning, where heavy lake effect snow in northern Oswego County quickly brought the event totals up towards 2 feet of snow.  Lake effect snows continued, somewhat disorganized through Friday Night. On Saturday morning these lake bands formed mesolows on the east side of both lakes. As for Lake Erie, Saturday morning the band was hugging the shoreline from about Ripley to Angola. This made for hazardous travel conditions along the I-90 Thruway in this corridor, with all commercial traffic banned for much of the day.

This first round of heavy rain waned by late morning, with light to moderate rainfall persisting through midday as temperatures climbed into the mid 60s. A secondary line of heavier rain, with isolated thunder and strong winds, developed early afternoon. This second line of showers produced around another inch to an inch and half of rain as it moved east. |The combination of two round of moderate to heavy rainfall and saturated to partially frozen top soils resulted in rapid runoff. Rivers across the region rose quickly following the first round of rainfall, but it was the contribution of the second round of rainfall that resulted in some rivers reaching moderate to major flood stages. Widespread flooding away from the mainstem rivers was common, though the damage to property was limited to basements and road closures in most instances. The flooding was limited to areas where rainfall totals exceeded 1.50���, with the hardest hit areas in Stark and Portage Counties in Ohio and Erie and Crawford Counties in Pennsylvania. Temperatures dropped during the evening of the 12th into the 30s and runoff gradually diminished.  Rivers flooded portions of the Scioto, Mohican, Muskingum, Black, Cuyahoga, Mahoning River Basins as well as the French Creek in Pennsylvania.","Numerous roads were flooded across Richland County as 1.75 of rain fell between Wednesday Night the 11th and Thursday the 12th.

The round of storms began during the evening hours on the 21st and ended just before midnight. During the early morning event, areas south of I-20 in Mississippi were impacted. Most notably, an EF-3 tornado tracked through Lamar and Forrest counties, killing four people in Hattiesburg and injuring over 50 others. In addition, damaging winds, large hail and flash flooding occurred in other areas across south Mississippi. The evening event impacted a larger proportion of the ArkLaMiss, and brought wind damage as well as large hail and a strong tornado.","Multiple trees were blown down across the county. These included: a trees down across Highway 49 about 1.5 miles south of the Highway 590 intersection; trees were down on Cold Springs Road, Kelly Creek Road, Evergreen Church Road near Ray Harvey Road, and Three Notch Road near Wilson Road and Williams Road."

The first round of severe weather started during the mid-morning hours on Saturday, January 21, 2017 as a squall line pushed into southeast Alabama and the Florida panhandle. As it pushed eastward nine warnings were issued with a total of 18 damaging wind reports (trees and power lines downed) related to these storms. ||After a brief lull during Saturday evening as the aforementioned squall line washed out near the Gulf Coast, strong southerly flow returned late Saturday night as a warm front pushed northward across the Florida Big Bend and southern Georgia. Initially with this late Saturday night to early Sunday morning event, a strong supercell moved across southern Georgia producing a tornado that moved across Thomas and northern Brooks Counties. This was the first tornado across the area with this multi- day event. From the same supercell that produced the tornado in Thomas and northern Brooks Counties, another tornado developed that tracked across Brooks, Berrien and Cook Counties and this tornado resulted in 11 fatalities. This overnight into early Sunday morning event produced one more tornado, an EF-1 that struck Lowndes County. ||A final round of severe weather moved through Sunday afternoon as a warm front continued to push northward into southeast Alabama and southern Georgia while the main low and trailing cold front pushed eastward across the Florida panhandle and offshore regions. This afternoon round of supercells first produced a tornado in Henry County, AL. An hour and a half after the Henry County tornado, two more tornadoes developed, an EF-2 that struck Clay, Randolph and Calhoun Counties (Georgia) and an EF-1 tornado that hit Franklin County, FL. After this, a long tracked tornado (track length of more than 70 miles) moved across Albany (Dougherty County) and into Worth and Turner Counties, causing extensive damage and five fatalities. ||Overall this multi-day event resulted in seven tornadoes, 16 deaths and numerous injuries. Three days of damage surveys were conducted to rate the tornadoes on the Enhanced Fujita scale.","A large, long-track tornado touched down near Dougherty/Baker Co. line and traveled over 70 miles across Dougherty, Worth, Turner, and Wilcox Counties in South Georgia. The tornado lifted just east of Abbeville. The tornado caused significant damage along the track, resulting in 5 fatalities in Albany. Severe tree damage was observed along the entire path which was up to 1.2 miles wide. In many spots, 90 to 100 percent of the trees in the path were uprooted or snapped. In Dougherty County, the tornado touched down on Tarva Road. By the time it reached Newton, the tornado was approximately 1.25 miles wide. There was extensive tree damage and some minor to moderate damage to a few homes in this area, consistent with EF2 damage. The tornado moved through the Radium Springs area, destroying nearly every tree in its path and causing EF2 damage to several houses. Most houses in this area had significant damage from falling trees. The tornado then moved through several mobile home parks just west of U.S. 319, destroying many mobile homes and causing the 4 fatalities. Damage consistent with an EF3 tornado was observed just east of U.S. 319. The tornado caused a large portion of a warehouse at the Proctor and Gamble Plant to collapse and tossed several semi-trailers across Mock Road. Additional EF3 damage was observed at the Marine Corp Logistics Base, where multiple anchored double-wide trailers were completely destroyed. In addition, several concrete light poles were snapped near the base, and a large solid concrete building had its solid concrete roof shifted more than 2 inches. A well-built concrete block church on Sylvester Rd was demolished with only parts of a few walls remaining. The estimated wind speed at this point is 150 mph, the highest analyzed along the track. EF3 damage was also observed on Harris Road where a cement block church was destroyed.  Damage estimates exceeded $300 million according to a media article citing the Dougherty County Commissioner."

The first round of severe weather started during the mid-morning hours on Saturday, January 21, 2017 as a squall line pushed into southeast Alabama and the Florida panhandle. As it pushed eastward nine warnings were issued with a total of 18 damaging wind reports (trees and power lines downed) related to these storms. ||After a brief lull during Saturday evening as the aforementioned squall line washed out near the Gulf Coast, strong southerly flow returned late Saturday night as a warm front pushed northward across the Florida Big Bend and southern Georgia. Initially with this late Saturday night to early Sunday morning event, a strong supercell moved across southern Georgia producing a tornado that moved across Thomas and northern Brooks Counties. This was the first tornado across the area with this multi- day event. From the same supercell that produced the tornado in Thomas and northern Brooks Counties, another tornado developed that tracked across Brooks, Berrien and Cook Counties and this tornado resulted in 11 fatalities. This overnight into early Sunday morning event produced one more tornado, an EF-1 that struck Lowndes County. ||A final round of severe weather moved through Sunday afternoon as a warm front continued to push northward into southeast Alabama and southern Georgia while the main low and trailing cold front pushed eastward across the Florida panhandle and offshore regions. This afternoon round of supercells first produced a tornado in Henry County, AL. An hour and a half after the Henry County tornado, two more tornadoes developed, an EF-2 that struck Clay, Randolph and Calhoun Counties (Georgia) and an EF-1 tornado that hit Franklin County, FL. After this, a long tracked tornado (track length of more than 70 miles) moved across Albany (Dougherty County) and into Worth and Turner Counties, causing extensive damage and five fatalities. ||Overall this multi-day event resulted in seven tornadoes, 16 deaths and numerous injuries. Three days of damage surveys were conducted to rate the tornadoes on the Enhanced Fujita scale.","This is a continuation of the EF3 tornado from Worth and Dougherty counties. The tornado entered Turner County along and north of Son Story Road with max winds estimated around 150 mph. Damage to a frame home along Ireland road was consistent with EF3 damage. Additional EF2 damage was found along this road. There was also some evidence for multiple vortices near the intersection of Ireland Road and U.S. 41. Additional EF3 damage was observed on King Burgess Circle where a large frame house was severely damaged and multiple mobile homes were destroyed. The tornado continued northeast across Interstate 75 causing EF2 damage to several frame homes and mobile homes. Tree damage diminished as the tornado approach the Wilcox county line, suggesting that the tornado temporarily weakened.

Multi band structured lake effect snow began east of Lake Erie and Ontario through the afternoon hours of Wednesday, January 4th.  Embedded within these bands were several stronger bands, which brought very narrow stripes of heavy snow east of the lakes, before the winds began to veer, sending snows southward overnight across the Ski Country and the Southern Tier east of Lake Erie, and across the southern Tug Hill east of Lake Ontario. Backing winds began to lift a plume of lake effect snow from over the Southern Tier and Ski Country early Thursday morning towards the far southern towns of Buffalo by late morning Thursday. Snowfall rates began to increase to 3 inches per hour along and just inland from the Lake Erie shoreline early Thursday afternoon. By mid to late afternoon on Thursday the band of snow was oriented along the long axis of Lake Erie, where added low level convergence and residence time over the lake strengthened the band of snow to 4 to 5 inches per hour over an area from Lake View to Orchard Park on the south side of the band, and Blasdell and West Seneca on the north side of the band. This heavy snowfall, combined with the late afternoon rush hour of people leaving work and schools, brought traffic to a standstill over the Buffalo Southtowns. The snow accumulated so quickly that plows were unable to keep up with the clearing of the snow, which led to people abandoning their cars on the Thruway and local roads, evening commutes extending to 6 hours or more, and school busses returning back to school, unable to deliver children to their homes. This snow band reached its northern extent from the City of Buffalo and near the southern end of the airport before starting to slide southward through the late evening and overnight hours. Snowfall rates were not as strong later in the evening, which allowed the plows to begin the dig-out from an event that dropped over two-feet of fresh snow over portions of the Buffalo Southtowns in only 6 to 8 hours. Snowfall decreased rapidly farther inland, with just several inches falling over far northeastern Erie County, and into Genesee and Livingston Counties. East of Lake Ontario Thursday, the snow band remained anchored over northern and central Jefferson and northern Lewis Counties. The low level convergent wind was so strong that the upstream shortwave nudge the band only slightly northward, but still added additional low level moisture that brought snowfall rates of 4 inches per hour to Watertown, Fort Drum and other central Jefferson County communities.  Later Thursday night, and early Friday morning the lake effect snow band dropped back south towards the Tug Hill region, bringing an additional half to one foot of snow through the night. The snow band transitioned into an anticyclonic structure towards Friday morning, where heavy lake effect snow in northern Oswego County quickly brought the event totals up towards 2 feet of snow.  Lake effect snows continued, somewhat disorganized through Friday Night. On Saturday morning these lake bands formed mesolows on the east side of both lakes. As for Lake Erie, Saturday morning the band was hugging the shoreline from about Ripley to Angola. This made for hazardous travel conditions along the I-90 Thruway in this corridor, with all commercial traffic banned for much of the day. By Saturday afternoon and evening, the band pushed inland across northern Chautauqua, northern Cattaraugus and southern Erie counties. Saturday night the band reoriented across the western Southern Tier on the westerly flow, producing a multi-banded structure with upslope enhancement over the Chautauqua Ridge and Boston Hills. On Lake Ontario Saturday, a mesolow developed on the east end of the lake, with a tea kettle band in place across the center of the lake. Initially, snow on the south side of the mesolow was impacting the shoreline of northern Cayuga and Oswego County, near the city of Oswego. By late morning Saturday, the mesolow moved farther offshore bringing a break in the snowfall east of Lake Ontario until the afternoon. The center of the mesolow made landfall across central Oswego County, with the heaviest snow concentrated on the south side of the low, as is typically the case. During the course of the evening, the lingering enhanced area of convergence on the south side of the mesolow focused a band of heavy snow that slowly moved from northern Cayuga County into central Oswego County. Snowfall rates were observed at about 4 inches per hour in the heaviest part of the snow band. Overnight, a secondary mesolow tracked into northern Jefferson County bringing a burst of snow across Jefferson county and central Lewis county, although accumulations from this were fairly minor as the snow lost intensity away from the lake. Snowfall amounted to about a foot and half overnight in that most persistent band, with Oswego, Mexico and north of Fulton topping the list of reports. On Sunday, lake effect bands reoriented on a northwesterly flow. Lake effect snow began to diminish in intensity.  |Off Lake Erie, specific snowfall reports included:  46 inches at Perrysburg,  45 inches at Colden, 42 inches at Forestville, 33 inches at Springville, 28 inches at Blasdell, 27 inches at Glenwood, 26 inches at West Seneca and Boston, 24 inches at East Concord, 23 inches at Portland, West Seneca and Hamburg, 21 inches at Dunkirk and Orchard Park, 20 inches at Fredonia, 19 inches at Angola and Warsaw, 18 inches at Little Valley, East Aurora and Marilla, 17 inches at Ripley, 16 inches at Dayton, Silver Creek and New Albion, 14 inches at Attica and Wyoming,13 inches at Lackawanna, 12 inches at Kennedy and Warsaw, 11 inches at Franklinville, and 10 inches at Randolph.

Tuesday, January 2nd, 2017 was much warmer being in the 70s with severe weather and tornadoes, while in the wake over the two days after on Wednesday and Thursday, strong surface high pressure with much cooler air gradually filtered in. The strongest push of strong high pressure and colder air began to move in Friday morning.||A sharp contrast in temperatures existed across the area from the lower Mississippi Valley into the Gulf of Mexico as a stalled frontal boundary stayed situated along the coast. This helped the cold air stay locked in place over the area, with temperatures near freezing Friday morning. In addition, a strong upper level disturbance was helping to promote lift and an area of snowfall moving through Oklahoma/Arkansas region by early Friday morning. This area mostly stayed just to the north of the region. Along and over top of the shallow arctic airmass, as the upper disturbance approached, moisture began to overrun the cold air below by early Friday morning. This moisture gradually overran the entire region by mid-morning. The atmosphere contained a deep melting layer, that as a snowfall fell, it completely melted. However, there was enough of a layer below that near the ground that helped to refreeze most of the precipitation to fall in the form of sleet and freezing rain. Sleet began to fall by early morning over northeast Louisiana by early Friday morning and spreading to the north and east into most of the ArkLaMiss by mid morning to late afternoon. There were some cases of some shallow instability present for some thunder to occur with the sleet.||The main disturbance and lift occurred in the mid-late afternoon and heaviest sleet production occurred during that time, right around rush hour. To make matters worse, temperatures were hovering in the low 30s to upper 20s while precipitation was falling. Overall, with such cold temperatures throughout the afternoon, there was significant sleet accumulation, especially from Franklin Parish in Louisiana, southeast towards Adams County in Louisiana, over to Warren County in Mississippi, throughout the Jackson Metro area and east along I-20 towards Lauderdale County and as far north as Noxubee County. Heavy sleet occurred throughout this region, with some areas approaching a 1/2 to 1 inch of sleet. Some areas in east-northeast Mississippi had enough precipitation with temperatures cooling in the atmosphere to briefly change over to snow as well, near Meridian and east-northeast Mississippi.

With cold ground and road temperatures, significant icing and accumulation began across the roadways throughout portions of northeast Louisiana, central, east and northeast Mississippi, especially along the Interstate 20 corridor. This led to significant icing on roadways and bridges, leading to icy roadways and major traffic issues. Many accidents occurred across the region, leading to some major thoroughfares being shut down, at least temporarily, especially for portions of Interstate 55, Interstate 20 and other roadways. This led to many area residents encountering slow downs in traffic and some being stuck for many hours on the roadways.

Strong surface high, near 1030mb, was building into the central and southern Plains. Tuesday, January 2nd, 2017 was much warmer being in the 70s with severe weather and tornadoes, while in the wake over the two days after on Wednesday and Thursday, strong surface high pressure with much cooler air gradually filtered in. The strongest push of strong high pressure and colder air began to move in Friday morning.||A sharp contrast in temperatures existed across the area from the lower Mississippi Valley into the Gulf of Mexico as a stalled frontal boundary stayed situated along the coast. This helped the cold air stay locked in place over the area, with temperatures near freezing Friday morning. In addition, a strong upper level disturbance was helping to promote lift and an area of snowfall moving through Oklahoma/Arkansas region by early Friday morning. This area mostly stayed just to the north of the region. Along and over top of the shallow arctic airmass, as the upper disturbance approached, moisture began to overrun the cold air below by early Friday morning. This moisture gradually overran the entire region by mid-morning. The atmosphere contained a deep melting layer, that as a snowfall fell, it completely melted. However, there was enough of a layer below that near the ground that helped to refreeze most of the precipitation to fall in the form of sleet and freezing rain. Sleet began to fall by early morning over northeast Louisiana by early Friday morning and spreading to the north and east into most of the ArkLaMiss by mid morning to late afternoon. There were some cases of some shallow instability present for some thunder to occur with the sleet.||The main disturbance and lift occurred in the mid-late afternoon and heaviest sleet production occurred during that time, right around rush hour. To make matters worse, temperatures were hovering in the low 30s to upper 20s while precipitation was falling. Overall, with such cold temperatures throughout the afternoon, there was significant sleet accumulation, especially from Franklin Parish in Louisiana, southeast towards Adams County in Louisiana, over to Warren County in Mississippi, throughout the Jackson Metro area and east along I-20 towards Lauderdale County and as far north as Noxubee County. Heavy sleet occurred throughout this region, with some areas approaching a 1/2 to 1 inch of sleet. Some areas in east-northeast Mississippi had enough precipitation with temperatures cooling in the atmosphere to briefly change over to snow as well, near Meridian and east-northeast Mississippi. Most areas in southeast Mississippi were slower to change over to mixed precipitation until later in the event. With cold ground and road temperatures, significant icing and accumulation began across the roadways throughout portions of northeast Louisiana, central, east and northeast Mississippi, especially along the Interstate 20 corridor. This led to significant icing on roadways and bridges, leading to icy roadways and major traffic issues. Many accidents occurred across the region, leading to some major thoroughfares being shut down, at least temporarily, especially for portions of Interstate 55, Interstate 20 and other roadways. This led to many area residents encountering slow downs in traffic and some being stuck for many hours on the roadways. In addition, the Jackson International Airport had to be shut down due to icy runways. The disturbance gradually moved east late evening, helping the precipitation to taper off and move out by late evening, around 9-10PM.||The strong surface high built and strengthened near 1040mb, leading to much colder air filtering in overnight and through the weekend. This led to hard freeze conditions with highs struggling to reach the freezing mark, especially across central and northern areas. A snowpack existed over central Arkansas, northern Mississippi and southern Tennessee. With northerly winds over that snowpack, this helped to lock in even colder air and biting wind chills, with wind chills falling into the single digits over most of the area.

Some areas in east-northeast Mississippi had enough precipitation with temperatures cooling in the atmosphere to briefly change over to snow as well, near Meridian and east-northeast Mississippi. Most areas in southeast Mississippi were slower to change over to mixed precipitation until later in the event. With cold ground and road temperatures, significant icing and accumulation began across the roadways throughout portions of northeast Louisiana, central, east and northeast Mississippi, especially along the Interstate 20 corridor. This led to significant icing on roadways and bridges, leading to icy roadways and major traffic issues. Many accidents occurred across the region, leading to some major thoroughfares being shut down, at least temporarily, especially for portions of Interstate 55, Interstate 20 and other roadways. This led to many area residents encountering slow downs in traffic and some being stuck for many hours on the roadways. In addition, the Jackson International Airport had to be shut down due to icy runways. The disturbance gradually moved east late evening, helping the precipitation to taper off and move out by late evening, around 9-10PM.||The strong surface high built and strengthened near 1040mb, leading to much colder air filtering in overnight and through the weekend. This led to hard freeze conditions with highs struggling to reach the freezing mark, especially across central and northern areas. A snowpack existed over central Arkansas, northern Mississippi and southern Tennessee. With northerly winds over that snowpack, this helped to lock in even colder air and biting wind chills, with wind chills falling into the single digits over most of the area. Some areas in the Delta stayed below freezing for over 60 hours. This in addition to temperatures falling into the low-mid teens over the next several nights, kept a lot of winter weather accumulation to linger around through the weekend, with icy roadways for the next couple of days into Saturday, January 7th and Sunday, January 8th. This led to significant traffic issues lingering into the early weekend, with roadways gradually improving as some of that melted under full sun by Saturday and mostly gone by Sunday into the start of the following work week. This significant winter weather event will be one that will be remembered for years to come.","Up to one-half inch of sleet accumulated on Bridges, overpasses and other elevated surfaces.

Strong surface high, near 1030mb, was building into the central and southern Plains. Tuesday, January 2nd, 2017 was much warmer being in the 70s with severe weather and tornadoes, while in the wake over the two days after on Wednesday and Thursday, strong surface high pressure with much cooler air gradually filtered in. The strongest push of strong high pressure and colder air began to move in Friday morning.||A sharp contrast in temperatures existed across the area from the lower Mississippi Valley into the Gulf of Mexico as a stalled frontal boundary stayed situated along the coast. This helped the cold air stay locked in place over the area, with temperatures near freezing Friday morning. In addition, a strong upper level disturbance was helping to promote lift and an area of snowfall moving through Oklahoma/Arkansas region by early Friday morning. This area mostly stayed just to the north of the region. Along and over top of the shallow arctic airmass, as the upper disturbance approached, moisture began to overrun the cold air below by early Friday morning. This moisture gradually overran the entire region by mid-morning. The atmosphere contained a deep melting layer, that as a snowfall fell, it completely melted. However, there was enough of a layer below that near the ground that helped to refreeze most of the precipitation to fall in the form of sleet and freezing rain. Sleet began to fall by early morning over northeast Louisiana by early Friday morning and spreading to the north and east into most of the ArkLaMiss by mid morning to late afternoon. There were some cases of some shallow instability present for some thunder to occur with the sleet.||The main disturbance and lift occurred in the mid-late afternoon and heaviest sleet production occurred during that time, right around rush hour. To make matters worse, temperatures were hovering in the low 30s to upper 20s while precipitation was falling.

The first round of severe weather started during the mid-morning hours on Saturday, January 21, 2017 as a squall line pushed into southeast Alabama and the Florida panhandle. As it pushed eastward nine warnings were issued with a total of 18 damaging wind reports (trees and power lines downed) related to these storms. ||After a brief lull during Saturday evening as the aforementioned squall line washed out near the Gulf Coast, strong southerly flow returned late Saturday night as a warm front pushed northward across the Florida Big Bend and southern Georgia. Initially with this late Saturday night to early Sunday morning event, a strong supercell moved across southern Georgia producing a tornado that moved across Thomas and northern Brooks Counties. This was the first tornado across the area with this multi- day event. From the same supercell that produced the tornado in Thomas and northern Brooks Counties, another tornado developed that tracked across Brooks, Berrien and Cook Counties and this tornado resulted in 11 fatalities. This overnight into early Sunday morning event produced one more tornado, an EF-1 that struck Lowndes County. ||A final round of severe weather moved through Sunday afternoon as a warm front continued to push northward into southeast Alabama and southern Georgia while the main low and trailing cold front pushed eastward across the Florida panhandle and offshore regions. This afternoon round of supercells first produced a tornado in Henry County, AL. An hour and a half after the Henry County tornado, two more tornadoes developed, an EF-2 that struck Clay, Randolph and Calhoun Counties (Georgia) and an EF-1 tornado that hit Franklin County, FL. After this, a long tracked tornado (track length of more than 70 miles) moved across Albany (Dougherty County) and into Worth and Turner Counties, causing extensive damage and five fatalities. ||Overall this multi-day event resulted in seven tornadoes, 16 deaths and numerous injuries.

The atmosphere over central Georgia was unseasonably warm and unstable with strong low and mid-level shear. The first short wave generated a wave of severe thunderstorms across central and south Georgia through the morning and into the afternoon of the 21st that produced numerous tornadoes. Twenty three tornadoes were confirmed in the WFO Peachtree City warning area with 27 total tornadoes confirmed in the state of Georgia, both records for the number of tornadoes in a single day. A second, stronger short wave swept through during the late morning and afternoon of the 22nd bringing another round of severe weather to central and south Georgia. Additional tornadoes confirmed brought the 2-day total to 27 for the WFO Peachtree City warning area and 41 for the state of Georgia, both a record number for a 2 day period.","A National Weather Service survey team found that the EF1 tornado that began in Talbot County moved into Upson County with maximum winds of 105 MPH and a maximum path width of 300 yards. The tornado crossed the Flint River into Upson County in the Sprewell Bluff State Park where it snapped and uprooted trees and overturned a small outbuilding. At this point the tornado, which had been moving northeast, turned more easterly crossing Double Bridges Road, where at least 3 dozen trees were downed across the roadway, before crossing Roland Road north of Highway 36 downing more trees and damaging the roof a home. Further east the tornado crossed Hollman Drive and Sunnyside Road where it crossed the path of another tornado that had passed just minutes before.
